      "Brandon Kintzler is a Cub. (Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)   by Jorge Castillo August 1 at 11:25 AM Email the author   Brandon Kintzler did not report to Nationals Park on Tuesday afternoon thinking he had played his final game for the Washington Nationals. The trade deadline was approaching, but he thought he was safe. The reliever prepared for the club’s game against the New York Mets as usual. Then, about an hour before the 4 p.m. nonwaiver trade deadline, he was summoned to Manager Dave Martinez’s office. “Am I getting traded?” Kintzler asked. He was, he was told. Kintzler thought it was a joke. “Pretty shocked,” he said. After all the speculation swirling around the organization over the previous 24 hours, the only trade the Nationals completed before Tuesday’s deadline was shipping Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs, a National League playoff contender, for Jhon Romero, a minor league right-hander who hasn’t pitched above Class A. He owns a 3.27 ERA in 32 relief appearances for the Cubs’ high-A affiliate. He isn’t helping the big league club anytime soon. [Bryce Harper on Nationals considering trades: ‘Glad I’m still inside this clubhouse’] On the surface, trading Kintzler for a low-level prospect while keeping the rest of the team intact to make a run for a postseason berth is not sensible. The Nationals acquired Kintzler at the deadline exactly a year earlier as part of their midseason bullpen overhaul. He teamed up with Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson to solidify Washington’s relief corps last year. He was a valuable piece last season and has been this season. He has a 1.88 ERA in 14 1/3 innings since June 28. That was good enough for the Cubs, the National League Central’s first-place club, to add him. “I felt like I was throwing the ball well,” Kintzler said. “I can go help a contender, another contender, right now. I don’t know. Just shellshocked right now. At a loss for words.” The Nationals gave their reasons for trading Kintzler publicly, but a significant reason went unspoken. Club officials believed Kintzler was an anonymous source for reports that cited clubhouse strife, according to people with knowledge of the situation. In a radio interview on 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday, Kintzler denied he was a source for Yahoo’s recent story, which called the Nationals’ clubhouse “a mess.” “I’ve never talked to that [author] Jeff Passan guy in my life, so that’s an interesting accusation,” Kintzler said on “Grant & Danny.” “I know for a fact that someone got him to admit his source was not a player, so it wasn’t me. I’ve never talked to that guy in my life.” Martinez said the reason Washington traded Kintzler was to give the spot to Wander Suero, who can pitch multiple innings and provide length. Suero was called up from Class AAA Syracuse about an hour before Tuesday’s game against the Mets. Martinez said the club figured Madson, recently acquired Kelvin Herrera and Sean Doolittle, whenever he comes off the disabled list, composed a strong enough back end. Dealing from that surplus allowed the team to address another need, Martinez explained. “I think that’s missing in the bullpen,” Martinez said. “Look, Brandon was awesome. He got some big outs for us, he really did. Of course, he’s going to be missed in the bullpen, but I think moving forward having some length to go with [Matt Grace] is important. It really is.” Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said he believed Suero deserved a spot in the majors and will be a vital piece in the future. The 26-year-old Suero has pitched to a 3.15 ERA in 16 games in a couple stints for the Nationals this season. He lasted appeared in a game for Washington on July 14, when he tossed 2 2/3 scoreless innings. [Svrluga: Nats hang on to Bryce Harper at deadline as Mike Rizzo bets on horses he rode in on] Rizzo hinted that Koda Glover, who has made eight minor league appearances after missing the season’s first four months with a shoulder injury, could join the team soon to bolster the bullpen. He also suggested moving Kintzler was, to some extent, financially motivated. Kintzler has a mutual option for next season; if the team doesn’t pick up a $10 million team option, he can pick up a $5 million player option. “It gives us financial flexibility, this year and next year going forward,” Rizzo said. “And we felt it was the prudent move, like all the moves we make, with 2018 and beyond in mind.” That mutual option is part of the contract Kintzler signed with the Nationals in December. He received offers on the table from other teams for more money and a more prominent role, but chose the Nationals because he liked the clubhouse and the organization. He felt at home. Teammates got along with him. He was close with Doolittle and Max Scherzer, often bouncing ideas off them.  He played the role of pitching coach, helping Tanner Roark and Gio Gonzalez with their mechanics during their struggles this season. His presence was felt. “He helped me a lot in my career just in the years that we spent together so I’m going to miss him,” Doolittle said. “We’re going to miss his ability on the field. I think we’re going to miss him in the clubhouse as well.” But he also rubbed some people the wrong way because he was willing to speak his mind more than others. Perhaps that was the lone  factor in the Nationals’ decision. Regardless, Kintzler is a Cub now, and he didn’t see it coming. “In the beginning, you care because it’s your character,” Kintzler said. “I work really hard, I feel like, to be a good teammate. I always thought I was a good teammate and everyone in that clubhouse thought I was a good teammate. When someone tries to say something about your character as far as how you are in the clubhouse, that hurts a little bit, but it’s just an opinion of one person and they can think what they want. I thought I did a good job there. New beginnings today and it is what it is. Put it behind me and I can’t wait to face them next week.” Scott Allen contributed to this report.

(Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)   by Matt Bonesteel July 31 Email the author   As hard as it might be to imagine, Alex Trebek cannot go on hosting “Jeopardy!” forever. He turned 78 on July 22 and has had a number of health scares over the years, including brain surgery to remove blood clots in December, and with his contract expiring in 2020 he is thinking of retirement. In a chat\\xa0Sunday with Harvey Levin on Fox News Channel’s “OBJECTified,” he said his chances of staying at the podium past that date are “50/50 and a little less.” But like “The Price Is Right” after Bob Barker handed off his skinny microphone to Drew Carey, “Jeopardy!” seems almost certain to continue after Trebek’s departure. It averages nearly 10 million viewers per week, making it one of the most-watched shows on television and a massive profit generator for Sony Pictures Television. So eventually “Jeopardy!” will need a new host, and Trebek has just the guy in mind. But unless you’re an ardent fan of the Los Angeles Kings, you have probably never heard of him. “I mentioned to our producer not so long ago that the fellow who does play-by-play for the Los Angeles Kings, they should consider him,” Trebek told Levin. That fellow is Alex Faust, who recently completed his first season calling Kings games on TV for Fox Sports West after replacing the legendary Bob Miller. He’s 28 years old and seems pretty thrilled to receive the Trebek seal of approval.   I guess there are worse ways to randomly see your name show up on TMZ! 🤷🏻\\u200d♂️I’m flattered by Mr. Trebek’s kind words, and delighted to hear he’s a big @LAKings fan! 👑— Alex Faust (@alex_faust) July 30, 2018    Faust was plucked from relative obscurity to replace Miller, who had called Kings games for nearly the entirety of the franchise’s existence. The Brooklyn-born Faust had spent the early portion of his career working\\xa0college football, basketball and lacrosse games for ESPNU along with a smattering of minor league hockey and some work on NBC Sports Network’s NHL coverage. It was a big leap from all that to the Kings, and it would be a colossal ascent from there to “Jeopardy!”      Trebek told Levin he did have one other person in mind as a possible replacement:\\xa0CNN legal analyst and SiriusXM radio host Laura Coates, who said on Twitter that she watches “Jeopardy!” every day.

He peered through black-rimmed glasses and gripped a microphone as he spoke. It looked like a pencil in his big, basketball hands.  “In closing, thank you so much,” James said. “We love you!” the crowd shouted. “I love you, too,” he replied. “I really do. I really do.” And when the cheers softened, The Kid From Akron ended a day in which he strengthened his commitment to his hometown by doing something seemingly contradictory. He said goodbye. “And know, no matter if I’m playing in Los Angeles or not, Akron, Ohio, is always home for me,” James said. “Always.” James called Monday perhaps the greatest day of his life. He celebrated the opening of the I Promise School, the offspring of an enterprising partnership between his foundation and Akron Public Schools that intends to change the lives of some of the city’s most underprivileged children. But this was also his first public appearance since he left the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Los Angeles Lakers in early July. And so if this was the greatest day of his life, he also admitted it was bittersweet. “On one hand, I’m opening up a school where I would love to be here every single day when my schedule permits,” James said late Monday afternoon, standing in a classroom in the stunning facility. “And then on the other hand, I’m starting a new journey in my life where I’m on the other coast. But when you have the support system and you have the people around you that’s helped you along the way, you know you never travel alone. So it makes the transition easier.” [As LeBron James heads west, can the once-great Lakers rise to his level?] James is moving away. And he is staying forever. In his world, this is neither contradictory nor unorthodox. He doesn’t feel the need to choose. He can be King James and The Kid from Akron. He can live in just one place, but his impact can be ubiquitous. He can satisfy his worldly curiosity while keeping his promise to uplift his home region. As James’s two passions clashed on this day, it was also clear what allows them to operate jointly: ambition. Whatever the persona or pursuit, it is ambition that makes James the quintessential American sports superstar. In everything he does, he refuses to settle, and he dreams a little differently. So it figures he would be the fish that wants to swim in the small and big pond simultaneously. On Monday, he made history at home and fantasized about adding to the tradition of the Lakers, one of the NBA’s historic superpowers. “There’s no reason you should become a Laker, become a Yankee, become part of Man U, become part of some franchise or clubs like that, and you don’t think about winning championships or winning at the highest level,” James said. “That’s what the history is all about.” But for the most part, James kept his reasoning for signing with the Lakers understated. He talked a little about it to appease the media, which he thanked for coming to Akron to cover the school opening. But he was adamant about focusing on the I Promise School. When James returned to the Cavaliers four years ago, he was intent on fulfilling a promise. He wanted to deliver a championship, which he did in the most dramatic manner possible in 2016, upsetting the 73-win Golden State Warriors after falling behind 3-1 in the NBA Finals. But he also wanted to make more of a difference at home. A few years ago, James was brainstorming with Michele Campbell, the executive director of the LeBron James Family Foundation. They were talking about making an even greater impact. In 2011, the foundation established its I Promise program, taking on a class of third graders and giving them the resources, incentives and support — academically and emotionally — to thrive. Campbell’s idea for a school was the extension of that concept. She thought she was just thinking out loud — couldn’t we help more kids and families with an entire school? — but James reacted seriously. “Well, why aren’t you doing that then?” James said, according to Campbell. The I Promise School has begun with 240 students, 120 each in the third and fourth grades. The plan is to expand gradually and serve students from kindergarten to eighth grade by 2022. The students being served have dire academic and emotional needs. They are some of the lowest-performing students in the district. The mission is to turn around the children’s academic lives by changing the lives of everyone in their families. The school provides services to assist children dealing with trauma and to support and educate parents trying to survive poverty. At the school, there are opportunities for parents who didn’t graduate high school to study for their GEDs. There is a pantry with donations from a food bank, and parents can pick up groceries to take home and prepare meals. They call this approach “family wraparound support.” “I think the missing link in public education is that family wraparound support,” Principal Brandi Davis said. “Because our students come to school, and they’re worried about things at home. It could be a wealth of issues going on at home. Just to know when I drop my child off at school I can go down the hallway to the family resource center and get the support I need, that just takes so much off of a parent, so much off of a child. And that’s what that trauma-informed support is all about. We want to create that safe, that secure and that caring and loving environment for our families and our students so that our kids can focus on education. And that’s what we’re all about.” This is James’s vision, right down to having 240 bicycles available so that every student has a free bike to ride. As a child, James found freedom on his bike. It helped him flee his dangerous neighborhood and venture to the parts of the city where he could play basketball, engage in productive activities and allow the community to help him. The thoughtfulness of James and his mother, Gloria, is evident in the school. They were able to turn their past pain into a crystallized understanding of what impoverished families need. James can recall missing 83 days of school as a fourth grader and being in danger of becoming “a statistic” before members of the community helped him. “School didn’t mean anything, obviously, back then,” James said of himself. “It was a surprise to me when I woke up and I was actually going to school. A lot of empty days, a lot of empty nights.” Look at him now. He’s a superstar of superstars. He knows he’s special, but he also thinks he’s lucky. He encountered people who cared, and they put him on the right path. Then basketball took his life to another level. “That’s what kids want to know, ‘Do you care about me?’\\u2009” James said. “And we do here.” The goal for the I Promise School is the same as the rest of James’s goals: Be great. The challenge is tremendous, but with one tour of the school, you can see clearly that the investment is serious. From the moment you walk in and see 114 of James’s game-worn shoes hanging from the walls in decorative fashion, you think about what dreamers can do with proper support. “Limitation is not in my vocabulary,” Davis said. “There’s always a way to get around. Working with the LeBron James Family Foundation, they have truly removed all barriers in more ways than one.” As James departs for Los Angeles, perhaps for good, he leaves behind a legacy that will outlast him. Monday was incredible — and bittersweet. But if this school lives up to its promise, time will erase any conflicted feelings. King James is moving away. The spirit of The Kid from Akron is staying forever.

(Dylan Buell/Getty Images)   by Chelsea Janes July 31 at 7:47 PM Email the author   Trea Turner had tears in his eyes when he sat down in front of reporters Tuesday afternoon. He took a deep breath before he spoke, visibly shaken, as if a great weight had settled onto his shoulders in the day since racially insensitive and homophobic tweets from his college years resurfaced Sunday. No standard unit exists for measuring sincerity, but Turner, who\\xa0has never been one to show emotion, looked every bit like a man experiencing the reality of his guilt, not searching for a way to explain it away. “For starters, I want to apologize everybody that was affected by things that I said: LBGT community, African American community, special needs community,” Turner said, speaking without notes or a prepared speech in front of him, eyes welled. “I’m truly sorry for what I said and I want to take full responsibility for that. I want to apologize to my teammates, I just talked to them, make sure that they know my thoughts and where I’m at. I want to apologize to Mike Rizzo and the Nationals for bringing this distraction to their team, their organization, sorry for that as well. Most importantly, apologize to the fans. A lot of fans had been sharing their thoughts in the last few days and I’ve had a chance to read a few of them. I think that’s where it is most affected by what I said and I want to apologize to those people.” [Svrluga: When an athlete’s ugly tweets hit home, ‘it feels like an actual gut-punch’] Turner did not make excuses for the comments. He pointed out that being a teenager does not remove responsibility, that no matter how old he was, he should have known better than to use homophobic slurs or derogatory terms for members of the special needs community . “It’s not when I said the things I said,” Turner said. “It’s that I said them at all.” Nationals management and players did not give excuses for Turner, either. All vouched for the man they see every day. “It can’t be glossed over,” Rizzo said. “Those things are very, very serious,” Rizzo said. “… The Trea Turner I know since we brought him into the organization is a fine human being. He’s a fine person and a guy who conducts himself in a very dignified, classy manner.” “There’s really no room for that kind of talk or language in the game of baseball, or really America and in the world,” Adam Eaton said. “… That being said, the year and a half I’ve known Trea, he’s been an outstanding person in all walks of life — doesn’t matter if you’re gay or straight, black, purple, orange. He’s been an outstanding person to all of us.” Dave Martinez choked up when asked about his shortstop, who has stopped by to check on the rookie manager at tough points in the season and has emerged as a respected presence in the clubhouse during his short career. Martinez condemned the tweets, said the organization doesn’t condone those things. Then, when asked how he knew Turner was sincere in his apologies, Martinez teared up and pushed through a few cracks of his normally steady voice. “[Trea] started crying,” Martinez said. “That tells me he’s sincere.” Turner’s demeanor suggested sincerity, whatever such cues are worth in situations like these. He did not try to dodge responsibility. He acknowledged how moved he was by fan stories. As for whether his views have changed? “I don’t think that I’ve ever had those views that people are saying about me,” Turner said. “[But it’s] fair. I think you can definitely accuse me of that.” Sean Doolittle, who posted a lengthy Twitter thread about the need for players to be more careful about what they post on social media and what happens when they do not, said he does not think Turner’s tweets “reflect who he is now.” Doolittle has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBT community, as well as the need for acceptance more broadly. [Sean Doolittle: ‘There’s no place for racism, insensitive language or even casual homophobia’] “I think sometimes when you’re that age, you might know those things are wrong to say but maybe you don’t know anybody that’s been personally affected by them. It’s tough for you to really understand the damage, the real damage that they can and do cause,” Doolittle said. “… He has the opportunity to demonstrate that growth and we have to give that space for him to be able to demonstrate that he’s grown and he’s changed since then.” Turner said he is trying to determine the best way to demonstrate that growth, to use his platform for good instead of the hurt he caused with those tweets. “I think going forward I can do a lot more things, I just need to assess what’s important to me, what can make the biggest difference,” Turner said. “From reading the last few days, being a kid and things kids go through is kind of overlooked. That’s something I would like to take part in. I have in the past couple years done quite a bit through the team, but doing more and more is better.” Turner already participates in MLB’s Shred Hate initiative, an anti-bullying program for which he has spoken to children and filmed public service ads. He said he does not feel that is enough, nor did he point to that as a way to get himself off the hook. He did not point to anything like that, nor hunt for a way out of what happened. Even after his news conference, Turner sat quietly at his locker, where anyone who wanted to could press him further. As he headed out for batting practice, he passed a young Nationals fan with a sign that read “Go Trea Turner.” He knows not everyone shares the notion now. “A lot of times people says kids, kids, kids. Kids look up to you the most,” Turner said. “But there’s plenty of adults that have reached out to me that gave their side of the story. It’s not just one person, one community, it’s a lot of people in a lot different places doing a lot of different things. I think that’s something that athletes have to keep in mind. It’s not a niche, or a small community, or one person, it’s much larger.” Read more baseball coverage: Bryce Harper on Nationals considering trades: ‘Glad I’m still inside this clubhouse’ MLB trade deadline delivers fireworks, as five former all-stars dealt in the final two hours Red Sox get second baseman Ian Kinsler as Tuesday’s 4 p.m. trade deadline draws near In Roberto Osuna, the Astros acquire an all-star closer — and an ongoing domestic violence case Braves’ Sean Newcomb addresses ugly old tweets right after just missing a no-hitter ', 'Trea Turner, in a tearful news conference, takes ‘full responsibility’ for his past tweets - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/07/31/we-want-johnny-manziel-chants-get-under-the-skin-of-montreal-alouettes-quarterback/': ('Johnny Manziel is ready for his Canadian close-up. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press via AP)   by Matt Bonesteel August 1 at 6:51 AM Email the author   Johnny Manziel will take a major step in his attempt at career revitalization Friday night, when he will start for the Montreal Alouettes at home against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. It will be his first appearance in a professional football game since December 2015, when he took his final snaps for the Cleveland Browns before the NFL franchise cut him months later after numerous off-field incidents.   🚨Confirmed!🚨Johnny Manziel will be the starting quarterback this Friday, August 3 against the @Ticats. #AlsMTL #ToujoursGame #JohnnyFootball #Number2 pic.twitter.com/Soy42t6IGx— #AlsMTL (@MTLAlouettes) July 31, 2018    “It’s good to be back in here,” Manziel told reporters Tuesday. “I felt like the thing I’ve been missing, even over the course of this year and a couple years, is reps. And as you guys have seen the last couple days, a chance to get with the 1s and get some reps is what I feel like I really need and what I’ve talked to a lot of people about. “So I feel very blessed to be in this position, to be back in a situation where I’m starting again. It’s good. It’s a quick turnaround. But at the same time, I’m excited for the opportunity.” The Alouettes acquired Manziel from the Tiger-Cats in a trade on July 22. Hamilton had signed the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner to a two-year contract in May but traded him after incumbent quarterback Jeremiah Masoli got off to a strong start to the CFL season. It quickly became apparent that Montreal Coach Mike Sherman intended to get Manziel onto the field as quickly as possible, with his team struggling to a 1-5 start. “We didn’t trade for Johnny to have him sit on the bench. Obviously he’s come here to get reps; to become the best player he can become. We started that process today,” Sherman said Monday, per the Montreal Gazette, about whether Manziel would replace incumbent starter Vernon Adams Jr. “You’ve all probably figured it out yourselves. At the same time, when you have two players [fairly equal], you probably wait until game time to make that announcement. It doesn’t make sense to do it any sooner.” Montreal has burned through four quarterbacks already this season, with\\xa0Drew Willy, Matt Shiltz and Jeff Mathews all getting injured — the Alouettes’ offensive line has allowed 23 sacks through six games — and Adams mostly ineffective in\\xa0Thursday night’s 44-23 home loss to the Edmonton Eskimos. During the game, fans chanted\\xa0“Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!” and “We want Johnny!” Some of them already had purchased Manziel jerseys. On Monday, the day Manziel began taking first-team snaps in practice, Adams expressed his extreme displeasure with that reaction. “Yes, it hurt me to hear that. I have nothing more to say or to give to the supporters of Montreal. Never again,” Adams\\xa0told La Presse, per TSN’s translation.\\xa0“Their behavior was very disrespectful. It was not like I was playing badly. I do not want them to ask me for anything, not even a small piece of equipment.” “I do not care what the situation is. It was a lack of respect and it affected me,” Adams continued.\\xa0“I tried anyways to make plays on the field. But that’s fine. In the future, I’ll treat the fans as they treated me. That’s all.” Adams’s frustration may stem from the fact that Manziel is about to cost him his second CFL job. The Tiger-Cats released Adams in June, ostensibly because they had signed Manziel to a two-year contract. Adams then signed with the Alouettes as a free agent, only to watch the team trade for Manziel. But before Thursday night’s game, he seemed to accept the fact that he would soon become the team’s backup, offering up much more measured comments than the “never again” diatribe he delivered after the loss. “Everybody knows Johnny didn’t come here to sit. They didn’t pay him just to sit. I understand he’s coming here to play,” Adams said. “As of right now, the Alouettes are [1-5]. I’m worried about winning a game. I’m not worried about what Johnny’s doing. “Coach gave me the start. I’m going to come out here, do my best, lead this team, be efficient on second down and just have fun. When I have fun, I play my best.” Manziel, who was not made available to reporters, apparently still has some work to do to get up to speed, though he said he was “getting there”:   #AlsMtl Day 2 prep, defence ramping up speed and it shows.

But now we have this opportunity to make other parents’ days different,” Miller’s wife, Morgan Beck Miller, said in a “Today” show interview that aired Monday morning. Emeline, known as Emmy, was 19 months old when she died June 10, the day after falling into a neighbor’s pool in Southern California in an accident her father said happened “in the blink of an eye.” It had been an ordinary day, Emmy’s mom, a professional beach volleyball player, recalled in the tearful interview. “Every morning, the kids would go swimming and Bode would go swimming with them, and they’d be in there for hours. And they loved it,” Morgan Miller said. After attending a birthday party, Morgan and Emmy stopped at home, where Bode was leaving to take his oldest daughter to a softball game.\\xa0(The couple has a son together and is expecting another child in October; Bode Miller has two children from other relationships.) “He was loading up the car when we got back and I gave him a kiss. And out of nowhere, [Emmy] leaned over and gave him another kiss. And we were so amused by her reaction because it was not typical of Emmy,” Morgan said. “So I kissed him again and she did it again and we laughed. Then I turned around and I walked inside and she waved and said bye to her dad.” She and her children then headed for their neighbors’ home. “We go over, back and forth, multiple times a week. They’re family to us,” Morgan said. “And it was just a normal day over there. We sat on the sofa, and she played in front of us.” With other kids playing nearby, “Emmy would go back and forth, which was all of 15 feet. And all of a sudden, it was just too quiet for me. We’re in mid-conversation and I stood up. And I turned and I went right to where the boys were and I said, ‘Where’s Emmy?’ ” Emmy’s father, an Olympic gold medalist in Alpine skiing, described her as “a bear” who “had such a powerful bull-like personality where she just did what she wanted.” That made the silence even more alarming. “Before Nate [their son] could respond, I turned around and the door that leads to the backyard, that was closed, had this tiny sliver of light coming through the side,” Morgan Miller said. “And my heart sank and I opened the door and she was floating in the pool. And I ran and I jumped in.” She started CPR, and the neighbor called 911. Although it initially appeared as if the baby might survive, “the doctor said her brain had just not had enough oxygen for too long of a time,” Bode Miller said. The Millers’ story is one that is familiar to all too many parents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified drowning as\\xa0the leading cause of death from unintentional injuries for children aged 1 to 4. The Millers had taken precautions, making sure their pool is surrounded by a fence. Now, they want to raise awareness. “We have the choice to live our days with purpose,” Morgan Miller said, “to make sure that no other parent has to feel what we’re feeling.”       We want to thank our friends, family and every one of you who sent a message, said a prayer or donated for the overwhelming expression of support - we are truly touched and blessed. Our midwives started a gofundme campaign to raise funds and we intend to donate these funds raised to worthwhile causes connected to water safety education. We are inspired to make our baby girls memory go forth and help prevent as many drownings as possible. We will post more soon on our plans and efforts.

(Patrick Semansky/Associated Press)   by Emily Giambalvo July 31 at 2:42 PM Email the author   OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Lamar Jackson won a Heisman Trophy as a quarterback. He set records in his three seasons at Louisville as a quarterback. The Baltimore Ravens traded up to select Jackson in the first round of this year’s NFL draft because of his success at that position. Yet when Baltimore kicks off its preseason slate with the Hall of Fame Game against the Chicago Bears on Thursday in Canton, Ohio, Jackson will be seeking to prove the simple fact that he is indeed still a quarterback. “That’s the first thing I want to show,” said Jackson, whom some NFL teams reportedly wanted to see work out as a wide receiver. “Just show my growth from college to my new chapter in life.” [A soccer player from Norway who once had a 92-yard punt has impressed at Ravens camp] Jackson, who won the Heisman as a 19-year-old sophomore in 2016, is behind veteran mainstay Joe Flacco on Baltimore’s depth chart. Flacco has been the Ravens’ starter for the last 10 years and led the team to a Super Bowl win after the 2012 season. With Flacco, however, the Ravens have missed out on the playoffs the past three years, and Jackson represents the team’s future if he is able to adjust to the NFL game. In preparation for his Ravens debut Thursday, his first live action since the TaxSlayer Bowl in December, Jackson said he has been practicing calling plays in front of the mirror. Ravens offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg said he will be looking to see if the adjustments Jackson has made in practice translate to the game environment. Sometimes, he said, players at any position can revert to old habits once they’re in a game situation. “I’ll probably have butterflies — my first NFL game,” Jackson said. “It’s not a real game, but it counts for me. Definitely butterflies. I can’t wait. I’m really anxious.” [Johnny Manziel to make first CFL start for Montreal Alouettes on Friday] Jackson cemented himself as an electric running quarterback at Louisville. Through his three years in college, Jackson accumulated more than 4,000 yards on the ground and 50 rushing touchdowns — in addition to more than 9,000 passing yards. But in the NFL, he will have to be smarter about when he decides to take off. That’s what Ravens backup Robert Griffin III had to learn when he entered the league as a mobile quarterback with the Washington Redskins in 2012. “I feel like he’s my little brother, but I’m not going to try as the big brother to tell him don’t do this,” said Griffin, whose Redskins tenure was derailed after he suffered a major knee injury at the end of his rookie season. “He’s going to have to learn some things on his own as he’s out there and he’s working. I think he’ll figure it out pretty quickly, and he’ll still be the dynamic player that he is.” Griffin described new quarterbacks coach James Urban as someone who “doesn’t try to coach the playmaker out of you.” There are times to push for extra yards, but there are also times to just get down, Griffin said. Griffin had to fight against his competitive nature to not treat every play like it was the last one of the game. He has talked to Jackson about the quicker pace of the NFL, and Jackson will start to learn firsthand beginning Thursday. “He’s got the tools and everybody around him to help him be successful,” Griffin said. “I think he’s been great about it, with listening. We’re just trying to teach him how to be a pro.” More on the NFL: Richard Sherman says Jerry Jones has an ‘old plantation mentality’ about anthem policy Dallas sportscaster rips Jerry Jones for his anthem stance and for not following it himself Panthers DB Ross Cockrell suffers an injury so horrible you could hear it ', 'Lamar Jackson did it all in college.

(Patrick Smith/Getty Images)   by Dan Steinberg July 30 Email the author   The resurfacing of old tweets containing offensive language has, in recent months, created ripples in college basketball (Donte DiVincenzo) and the NFL (Josh Allen), to say nothing of the entertainment and political realms. Major League Baseball now is in the spotlight, with successive news stories on years-old tweets sent by Brewers reliever Josh Hader, Braves pitcher Sean Newcomb and Nationals infielder Trea Turner. Those stories have prompted many, both inside and outside pro sports, to wonder why professional athletes don’t delete their entire Twitter histories when they become famous, eliminating any potentially offensive messages from the Internet. “If you’re on Twitter, please spend the five minutes it takes to scrub your account of anything you wouldn’t want plastered next to your face on the front page of a newspaper,” Cubs pitcher Jon Lester tweeted on Monday. “Better yet, don’t say stupid things in the first place. Too many young guys getting burned. …\\xa0Listen I’m far from the sharpest tool in the shed and there’s certainly no halo above my head (pardon the rhyme) but I know some of these guys are great dudes who just had lapses in judgment.” Lester clarified in subsequent tweets that he was not excusing any of the tweets in question, nor was he defending their authors. But his thought was a natural one, and a close cousin to another question being asked this week: With all they have to lose, why would professional athletes be on social media to begin with? [Svrluga: When an athlete’s ugly tweets hit home, ‘it feels like an actual gut-punch’] An answer to that particular question came Monday evening from Nats closer Sean Doolittle, in a lengthy and much-lauded string of messages. Doolittle’s basic thesis: Baseball needs to concern itself with the message, not the medium, and the message hasn’t always been good enough. “It’s been a tough couple of weeks for baseball on twitter,” Doolittle wrote. “It sucks to see racist and homophobic language coming from inside our league — a league I’m so proud to be a part of that I’ve worked really hard to make a more accepting and inclusive place for all our fans to enjoy.

Social media can be great for an athlete. I met my wife on twitter (long story). It helps athletes share their stories and personalities and connect with their community. Besides, it’s not like you can accidentally post a slur.” A brief aside: Doolittle wasn’t joking about meeting his wife on Twitter. He and Eireann Dolan retold the story of their online romance to The Washington Post’s Chelsea Janes this spring:  Fittingly, Doolittle and Dolan met on Twitter, a story they recalled fondly last week on the patio behind the Nationals’ complex. Dolan was friends with Doolittle’s teammate Brandon McCarthy. Doolittle would reply to their tweets now and then, not thinking much of it. After weeks of public replies, Dolan sent him a puzzling message — “Why are you funny?” “I was mad he was funny, because I don’t like when people are good at two different things,” Dolan said. “You should be good at baseball or you should be good at being funny online. He was both, and I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t care for this at all. You need to pick a side.’” Because he wouldn’t pick just baseball, they ended up on the same side in the end.  (If you’ll tolerate another brief aside, turns out your humble author also met his wife on Twitter. Thanks to a shared interest in, of all things, the Washington Wizards. And now we have a chubby little toddler girl with a dresser full of D.C. sports gear. So don’t say the Wizards, and Twitter, haven’t created any happiness in this crazy, mixed-up world.) Anyhow, back to Doolittle. “A lot of the tweets that have surfaced are from several years ago — from a time in their lives when they may not have realized the impact those words have,” he wrote. “But as you learn from and grow out of that youthful [indiscretion], delete those posts to reflect that growth.\\xa0Between all the people you meet and the places you go, there is a lot of opportunity for personal growth in baseball. It’s entirely possible that those old posts no longer reflect that person’s views. But actions will speak louder than words. “It’s a reminder that words matter, and that the impact the of words matter more than the intent. Rather than feeling like this platform makes us targets and we have to censor ourselves, find a way to use the platform to lift others up and make a positive impact.\\xa0It can be tough for athletes to understand why these words are so hurtful. Most of us have been at the top of the food chain since [high school], immune to insults. When all you’ve known is success and triumph it can be difficult to empathize with feeling vulnerable or marginalized. [Nationals’ Trea Turner is the latest MLB player to have ugly tweets uncovered] “Homophobic slurs are still used to make people feel soft or weak or otherwise inferior — which is [BS],” Doolittle wrote. “Some of the strongest people I know are from the LGBTQIA community. It takes courage to be your true self when your identity has been used as an insult or a pejorative.” (Another aside: Doolittle and Dolan have long been outspoken supporters of MLB pride nights, donating hundreds of tickets to the Oakland A’s pride night to\\xa0LGBT youth groups, recording a promo for this year’s Nats night\\xa0and visiting\\xa0SMYAL, a support and mentoring group for D.C.-area LGBTQ youth.

I hope we can learn from this and make the MLB a place where all our fans feel welcome.” While some fans and media members have found the recent apologies lacking, Doolittle earned enthusiastic praise for his remarks, which were widely shared on Monday.   sean doolittle is a great human— Janiece 🦄 (@feelingamazing) July 30, 2018      This is the thread I need from a major league ballplayer.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)   by Chelsea Janes August 1 at 12:30 PM Email the author   The message is clear now, delivered first by the trade of Brandon Kintzler, then emphatically when the Washington Nationals designated Shawn Kelley for assignment early Wednesday morning. “If you’re not in, you’re in the way,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said hours later, acknowledging that the reason he sent both men packing was his feeling that they were undermining clubhouse culture. Kelley threw his glove and glared into the dugout after allowing a home run to Austin Jackson in what had been a 25-1 game. Kelley said afterward that he was frustrated with umpires missing calls and prodding him on his pace. Manager Dave Martinez, protecting his player, said he believed that’s all it was. Rizzo said he saw what many who noticed Kelley’s glare inferred. Kelley was frustrated to be pitching in a game such as that one in the first place and showed up his manager. His agent, Mike McCann, later told ESPN Kelley was hoping Martinez would argue on his behalf. Rizzo thought differently. “I [interpreted as Kelley frustrated to be in the game]. It may not have been, but that’s the way I looked at it,” Rizzo said. ” .\\u2009.\\u2009. After what happened before the game yesterday, getting ready for post-deadline season, I thought it was truly a day we should have been happy and celebrating — we had a big win against a division rival and felt good about ourselves — and such a selfish act is not what we’re here for.” [‘Is it my turn to read?’: Mets’ TV broadcast got weird during 25-4 loss to Nats] The Nationals signed Kelley to a three-year, $15 million dollar deal before the 2016 season. In his 2 1/2 years with them, he grew into a beloved clubhouse presence, a jovial guy who made newcomers feel comfortable. After his outburst Tuesday night, Max Scherzer and Ryan Madson spoke with Kelley in hushed tones, the kind of conversation they do not usually have with veteran teammates after bad performances. Obviously, they noticed his reaction. Everyone did, and Rizzo believed he had to move. “It’s pretty cut and dry. You guys all saw it. The act that he portrayed on the field last night was disrespectful to the name on the front of the jersey, the organization, specifically Davey Martinez,” Rizzo said. “And you’re either in or you’re in the way. And I thought he was in the way.” [Svrluga: Nats hang on to Bryce Harper at deadline as Mike Rizzo bets on horses he rode in on] Kelley had bounced back from a brutal 2017 season and was pitching to a 3.34 ERA in 35 appearances. A person familiar with the Nationals’ plans said they listened to offers for the free agent-to-be before Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline and they could still get something for him now that he has been designated for assignment. He is the second well-liked veteran to go in the last 24 hours, as Rizzo dealt Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs just before the deadline. People familiar with the situation said Rizzo confronted Kintzler about being the anonymous source for various reports that painted an unflattering picture of the Nationals’ clubhouse culture. Kintzler denied being that source in an interview on 106.7 the Fan on Wednesday. “I’ve never talked to that [author] Jeff Passan guy in my life, so that’s an interesting accusation,” Kintzler said on the show “Grant & Danny.” “I know for a fact that someone got him to admit his source was not a player, so it wasn’t me. I’ve never talked to that guy in my life.” Rizzo didn’t explicitly acknowledge that clubhouse culture was the reasoning behind the Kintzler deal but did not reject the premise when asked whether his decisions on Kintzler and Kelley represented a shift in mentality about players who undermine their manager. “We’ve always had that stance. We’ve always had a stance that if you’re not with us, you’re against us, and you’re in the way,” Rizzo said. “The culture here has been so good for so long. We’ve had so much success over the last seven years that we’re not going to let anybody interfere with that success. . . . We’re not going to let any one person derail what we’re going to do.” Martinez seemed to struggle to with the move, eyes welling for the second time in two days when he spoke about having to designate Kelley, whom he said he “respected” and “is not a bad person.” The Nationals will have to absorb the remaining portion of Kelley’s salary, unless another team picks him up on waivers, which seems unlikely. That, in itself, should demonstrate the frustration the front office felt at his outburst and the optics it created for a team already answering questions about its clubhouse culture. Without him, the Nationals have lost two of their most outspoken veterans in the bullpen, leaving Madson, injured Sean Doolittle and newcomer Kelvin Herrera as the longest-tenured members of that corps. “Those are two guys within our bullpen, two of our more vocal guys. They were vocal leaders, and they led that way,” Doolittle said. “Now it’s going to fall on somebody to kind of step up and assume that role.” The Nationals recalled right-hander Jimmy Cordero to replace Kelley on the roster. The 26-year-old is pitching to a 1.88 ERA in 38 games for Syracuse this season and has struck out more than a batter per inning. In Cordero and Wander Suero, the Nationals get two durable, versatile relievers who can provide them multiple innings. Kintzler and Kelley, as more veteran players with injury histories, limited Martinez’s options more. But jettisoning Kelley was not about on-field performance. Rizzo left no doubt about that.

(Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)   by Jorge Castillo August 1 at 11:25 AM Email the author   Brandon Kintzler did not report to Nationals Park on Tuesday afternoon thinking he had played his final game for the Washington Nationals. The trade deadline was approaching, but he thought he was safe. The reliever prepared for the club’s game against the New York Mets as usual. Then, about an hour before the 4 p.m. nonwaiver trade deadline, he was summoned to Manager Dave Martinez’s office. “Am I getting traded?” Kintzler asked. He was, he was told. Kintzler thought it was a joke. “Pretty shocked,” he said. After all the speculation swirling around the organization over the previous 24 hours, the only trade the Nationals completed before Tuesday’s deadline was shipping Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs, a National League playoff contender, for Jhon Romero, a minor league right-hander who hasn’t pitched above Class A. He owns a 3.27 ERA in 32 relief appearances for the Cubs’ high-A affiliate. He isn’t helping the big league club anytime soon. [Bryce Harper on Nationals considering trades: ‘Glad I’m still inside this clubhouse’] On the surface, trading Kintzler for a low-level prospect while keeping the rest of the team intact to make a run for a postseason berth is not sensible. The Nationals acquired Kintzler at the deadline exactly a year earlier as part of their midseason bullpen overhaul. He teamed up with Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson to solidify Washington’s relief corps last year. He was a valuable piece last season and has been this season. He has a 1.88 ERA in 14 1/3 innings since June 28. That was good enough for the Cubs, the National League Central’s first-place club, to add him. “I felt like I was throwing the ball well,” Kintzler said. “I can go help a contender, another contender, right now. I don’t know. Just shellshocked right now. At a loss for words.” The Nationals gave their reasons for trading Kintzler publicly, but a significant reason went unspoken. Club officials believed Kintzler was an anonymous source for reports that cited clubhouse strife, according to people with knowledge of the situation. In a radio interview on 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday, Kintzler denied he was a source for Yahoo’s recent story, which called the Nationals’ clubhouse “a mess.” “I’ve never talked to that [author] Jeff Passan guy in my life, so that’s an interesting accusation,” Kintzler said on “Grant & Danny.” “I know for a fact that someone got him to admit his source was not a player, so it wasn’t me. I’ve never talked to that guy in my life.” Martinez said the reason Washington traded Kintzler was to give the spot to Wander Suero, who can pitch multiple innings and provide length. Suero was called up from Class AAA Syracuse about an hour before Tuesday’s game against the Mets. Martinez said the club figured Madson, recently acquired Kelvin Herrera and Sean Doolittle, whenever he comes off the disabled list, composed a strong enough back end. Dealing from that surplus allowed the team to address another need, Martinez explained. “I think that’s missing in the bullpen,” Martinez said. “Look, Brandon was awesome. He got some big outs for us, he really did. Of course, he’s going to be missed in the bullpen, but I think moving forward having some length to go with [Matt Grace] is important. It really is.” Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said he believed Suero deserved a spot in the majors and will be a vital piece in the future. The 26-year-old Suero has pitched to a 3.15 ERA in 16 games in a couple stints for the Nationals this season. He lasted appeared in a game for Washington on July 14, when he tossed 2 2/3 scoreless innings. [Svrluga: Nats hang on to Bryce Harper at deadline as Mike Rizzo bets on horses he rode in on] Rizzo hinted that Koda Glover, who has made eight minor league appearances after missing the season’s first four months with a shoulder injury, could join the team soon to bolster the bullpen. He also suggested moving Kintzler was, to some extent, financially motivated. Kintzler has a mutual option for next season; if the team doesn’t pick up a $10 million team option, he can pick up a $5 million player option. “It gives us financial flexibility, this year and next year going forward,” Rizzo said. “And we felt it was the prudent move, like all the moves we make, with 2018 and beyond in mind.” That mutual option is part of the contract Kintzler signed with the Nationals in December. He received offers on the table from other teams for more money and a more prominent role, but chose the Nationals because he liked the clubhouse and the organization. He felt at home. Teammates got along with him. He was close with Doolittle and Max Scherzer, often bouncing ideas off them.\\xa0 He played the role of pitching coach, helping Tanner Roark and Gio Gonzalez with their mechanics during their struggles this season. His presence was felt. “He helped me a lot in my career just in the years that we spent together so I’m going to miss him,” Doolittle said. “We’re going to miss his ability on the field. I think we’re going to miss him in the clubhouse as well.” But he also rubbed some people the wrong way because he was willing to speak his mind more than others. Perhaps that was the lone\\xa0 factor in the Nationals’ decision. Regardless, Kintzler is a Cub now, and he didn’t see it coming. “In the beginning, you care because it’s your character,” Kintzler said. “I work really hard, I feel like, to be a good teammate.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)   by Scott Allen August 1 at 10:25 AM Email the author   Things got weird on the Mets’ TV broadcast during the eighth inning of the Nationals’ record-setting, 25-4 victory Tuesday night — and that was before New York shortstop Jose Reyes made his pitching debut in the bottom of the frame. “With the score and the weather and everything being as it is, we are going to unveil another edition of what we like to call Media Guide Musings,” SNY analyst Gary Cohen said as Kevin Plawecki stepped in against Nationals pitcher Wander Suero with the rain falling and Washington leading 19-1 to start the inning. “This is going to be a collaborative effort. We’re going to start on page 420 of the Mets’ media guide, the postseason section. The first page of the postseason section is the 1969 League Championship Series, Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets.” For the next six minutes, Cohen and his broadcast partners, Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez, stopped calling the ugly action on the field and read directly from the media guide. It was a history lesson from happier times for the Mets, and it was brilliant.    (Via MLB.tv)  “In the club’s first-ever trip to the postseason, the Mets swept the best-of-five series versus Atlanta, three games to none,” Cohen began as the theme from “Masterpiece Theatre” played in the background. “In Game 1, trailing 5-4 in the top of the eighth, New York rallied for five runs and a 9-5 win. Tom Seaver struggled, allowed five runs in seven innings, but earned the victory. In Game 2, two-run home runs by Tommie Agee, Ken Boswell and Cleon Jones lifted the Mets to an 11-6 win. In front of 54,195 fans at Shea — I might add, parenthetically, I was one of them — New York advanced to the World Series with a 7-4 victory in Game 3. The lead changed hands three times before Wayne Garrett’s two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth put the Mets ahead 5-4. Nolan Ryan hurled seven innings in relief to pick up the win and complete the sweep. Boswell hit .333 with two home runs and five RBI, while Agee batted .357 with two home runs and four RBI. Hank Aaron cracked a home run in each game and drove in seven runs for the Braves. We’re going to move to page 422.” “Is it my turn to read?” Darling asked as the music continued to play and the booth continued to ignore whatever was happening on the field. “Page 422, if you have it at home, folks. This is the 1969 World Series, the Baltimore Orioles versus the Mets. The Mets, of course, won the series, 4-1. The New York Mets entered the 1969 World Series as heavy underdogs against Baltimore. After failing in Game 1, The Amazins rattled off four straight wins to earn their first championship just eight years after the franchise was born.” “It’s like a Seder,” Cohen said before Darling eventually passed the book to Hernandez. “A raucous Shea crowd of 56,335 watched the Mets shut out Baltimore, 5-0, in Game 3,” Hernandez said. “Tommie Agee hit a leadoff home run off Jim Palmer, the only leadoff home run the Hall of Famer would ever allow, to put the Mets on the board early.” [After a stress-packed deadline day, Nats hammer Mets in a laugher] Cohen wrapped up the impromptu story time by reading the guide’s account of the Mets’ World Series-clinching win on Oct. 16, 1969. By this point, there was one out in the inning and a runner on first. “Behind a 5-3 victory, New York’s lovable losers were champions,” he said. “The Orioles led 3-0 early, but home runs by [Donn] Clendenon and [Al] Weis tied the game. In the eighth, [Ron] Swoboda gave the Mets the lead with an RBI double. [Jerry] Koosman induced future Mets manager Davey Johnson to fly out to Cleon Jones in left field for the final out. Jones (Sport Magazine) and Weis (Baseball Writers of America) were the series MVPs. And so concludes page 422, the 1969 World Series.”  \\ufeff  Cohen and Co. previously passed the time during the late innings of yet another Mets loss by reading from the media guide\\xa0on July 10. Here are a few numbers from Tuesday’s game that would make good fodder for a future “Media Guide Musings” segment, perhaps as early as Wednesday’s matinee at Nationals Park. 7: Runs in the first inning for the Nationals, the most in the first inning by a National League team this season.

And even then, it wasn’t actually over, as a last-second deal — the Baltimore Orioles capping their summer fire sale by sending second baseman Jonathan Schoop to the Milwaukee Brewers — wasn’t made official until minutes after the 4 p.m. deadline. At the end of a frantic, frenzied day, which itself came at the end of a busy month of dealmaking, the competitive landscape had been remade across both leagues, as the 2018 season enters its final two months. Some of the biggest trades of the entire summer came in the final hours leading up to the deadline, with five former all-star players dealt in the two hours leading up to the deadline. Along with Schoop, who joins a crowded infield picture in Milwaukee, those all-stars were Washington Nationals closer Brandon Kintzler, who went to the Chicago Cubs in a curious move by the third-place team in the NL East; former Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos, who went from the Tampa Bay Rays to the Philadelphia Phillies despite currently residing on the disabled list; second baseman Brian Dozier going from the Minnesota Twins to the Los Angeles Dodgers; and right-handed starter Chris Archer going from the Rays to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Fueled by a healthy dose of pennant races — four divisions saw their first- and second-place teams separated by three or fewer games entering Tuesday, and both leagues’ wild-card races are free-for-alls — as well as an extreme case of stratification, with a relatively equal number of horrendous teams eager to sell and superteams eager to buy, this year’s trade market was active, robust and fruitful. All told, each of baseball’s 30 teams made moves during the month of July. No, Bryce Harper wasn’t traded, despite a rush of rumors that he might be. But among those who were traded in the weeks, days and hours leading up to Tuesday were a World Series most valuable player (lefty Cole Hamels, sent from the Texas Rangers to the Chicago Cubs) and a four-time all-star considered among the half-dozen or so best young players in the game (Manny Machado, from the Orioles to the Dodgers).    The Nationals’ trade of Brandon Kintzler qualified as a bit of a head-scratcher. (Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)  The Phillies got a catcher (Ramos) who is on the disabled list for at least a few more weeks, and the Braves got a reliever (former all-star Darren O’Day of the Orioles) who is out for the rest of this season, while the Houston Astros got a closer (Roberto Osuna from Toronto) who is still serving a 75-game suspension for violating the league’s domestic violence policy. [In Roberto Osuna, the Astros acquire an all-star closer — and an ongoing domestic violence case] Teams that looked like certain sellers a month ago (the Pirates) suddenly became aggressive buyers, while teams that looked like firm buyers a month ago (the Nationals) suddenly became tentative sellers. “It’s not about sending messages,” Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle, whose team recently ran off 11 straight wins to alter its trajectory, told reporters in Pittsburgh. “That, I think, is the most overrated term you can use in baseball. It gives us a better opportunity to deliver, and that’s what everyone is looking for — the fans, us, everybody.” Plenty of top prospects were dealt for veterans, of course, the best of them arguably being catcher/outfielder Francisco Mejia, rated 21st on MLB Pipeline’s list of the game’s top 100 prospects, whom the Cleveland Indians sent to San Diego in exchange for relievers Brad Hand and Adam Cimber. To no one’s surprise, the players most in demand, and most frequently dealt, were relief pitchers — a reality that underscored their growing importance across the game, especially in the crucible of the postseason. Nearly every contending team — the Yankees, Phillies, Indians, Pirates, Mariners, Astros, Braves, Brewers, Diamondbacks, A’s, Cubs, Rockies and Dodgers — made moves to bolster their bullpens in July. Basically, that’s every contending team except the Nationals, who added Kelvin Herrera in June, and the Red Sox, whose acquisition of starting pitcher Nathan Eovaldi will result in someone being moved to their bullpen. For the Nationals, who passed on an opportunity to sell off other pieces and retool for 2019, their task of trying to climb back into the playoff race was made tougher by the fact the teams they will need to vanquish in August and September, not to mention October, all got significantly better at the deadline. The Phillies, who entered Tuesday with a half-game lead over the Braves, got one of the best-hitting catchers in the game in Ramos (despite his present unavailability) and a lefty reliever in Aaron Loup from the Blue Jays, to go along with infielder Asdrubal Cabrera, whom they acquired from the Mets on Friday. The Braves, meanwhile, added a controllable starting pitcher (Kevin Gausman), a slugger (Adam Duvall) and plenty of bullpen help (O’Day, Brad Brach and Jonny Venters). But while the NL playoff picture is still wide open, with as many as 10 teams that consider themselves still alive, the AL is a different story. In the aftermath of Tuesday’s trade deadline, only six of its 15 teams — the Red Sox, Yankees, Indians, Astros, Mariners and A’s — are still competing in 2018, a sad commentary on baseball’s state of stratification. No team was a more aggressive seller than the Orioles, who, saddled with the game’s worst record, wound up dealing away six pieces of their core — Machado, Gausman, Schoop, O’Day, Brach and Zach Britton — for a total of 15 younger players, all but one of them minor leaguers, and international bonus-pool money. Now that the nonwaiver trade deadline has passed, August will be at least partly consumed with the second trade deadline, for which the involved players must clear waivers before being dealt. Players must be acquired by Aug.\\xa031 to be eligible for postseason rosters. Eleven months ago, the Astros acquired Detroit Tigers ace Justin Verlander with just minutes to go before the calendar flipped to September, a fateful move that paid off in a World Series victory that probably would not have been possible without Verlander. There probably won’t be anybody like Verlander available this August, but then again, few saw that trade happening in the days leading up to it. And there’s a good chance that whoever wins this year’s World Series may have already acquired their game-changer.

The Doctson play was a fourth-and-goal from the 5-yard-line with nine seconds remaining. On the play, quarterback Alex Smith targeted Doctson in the shallow right corner of the end zone. Cornerback Josh Norman had shadowed the receiver’s every moment, so he launched himself as Doctson did. Doctson stretched his fingertips but the ball glanced off them and, as Doctson slammed to the muddy turf, Norman fell on top of him, with his helmet hitting Doctson in his upper-body. Norman popped up and walked up away but Doctson remained on the ground. He tried to get up but fell again. Smith ran over and Norman crouched down while they waited for an evaluation.

Injuries hampered Doctson from the start. He missed his entire rookie preseason with an Achilles injury, then returned to make his first career reception in the season-opener against Pittsburgh. He made one catch the next week, a 57-yarder against Dallas, but in Week 3, Doctson aggravated the Achilles injury during pregame warm-ups and he missed the rest of the season. Then, in 2017, Doctson pulled his hamstring and missed the preseason opener. He was injury-free for the rest of the year and hauled in his first career touchdown grab in Week 3 against Oakland.

This year, Doctson has been building chemistry with new quarterback Alex Smith who, Doctson said, has shown more trust in his receivers more than last year’s starter, Kirk Cousins, did. Doctson is expected to take on a key role in the team’s passing game this season, as he demonstrated his ability to come down with contested catches last season and dating back to his college career.

But as his former teammates are inching closer to Week 1 of the 2018 season, Hall insists he’s “great” and at peace with his decision. “Yeah, yeah, I feel good,” Hall said Wednesday morning before heading out to join his former teammates on the field. “I mean, didn’t like the way last year ended. Obviously, I would have liked to have been prepared to play and things like that. But things happen for a reason. My goal last year was to not have a surgery; to be a great teammate, the best teammate I could be; a good leader and not have a surgery, and I accomplished that. So it just felt right. “I tell people all the time, as a leader in the last couple years, I was always trying to groom the next crop of guys to take my spot, and when I finally felt like they were ready, or it showed they were ready, it was time for me to go.” Hall spoke glowingly about fourth-year cornerback Quinton Dunbar, who signed a three-year extension earlier this offseason. “He’s amazing. Amazing,” he said of Dunbar, who is aiming to solidify his position as the starting cornerback opposite veteran Josh Norman. “He’s been playing lights-out football. Look at the way he’s transformed his body a little bit and his mentality. He’s done what I would have expected him to do, so I’m not surprised. So I’m proud to say I had a hand in helping him become the person he is, the player he is. Because he’s going to be hell now. He’s going to be hell.” And the change in Dunbar isn’t just physical, according to Hall. “It’s all of it, it’s the combination, it’s the mentality,” he added. “He’s learned over these years how to be a corner, he’s learned how not to only be a corner but a football player. I always talk about football players. I don’t care about a great corner or a great receiver, I want a great football player. I think he’s shown his maturity and he’s able to be a great football player.” More Redskins coverage: Redskins RB Chris Thompson getting his ‘groove’ back as he nears full health Derrius Guice says Redskins running backs are enjoying themselves amid competition As new helmet rule creates confusion around NFL, Redskins unsure how it will be enforced ', 'Former Redskins safety DeAngelo Hall swears — literally — that he is now retired - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/football-insider/wp/2018/08/01/redskins-rb-chris-thompson-getting-his-groove-back-as-he-nears-full-health/': ('Redskins quarterback Alex Smith will have a valuable weapon in his backfield in dual-threat running back Chris Thompson, right. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Kareem Copeland August 1 at 6:33 AM Email the author   The player in all white at the Redskins’ fifth training camp practice already stood out against the backdrop of teammates in burgundy pants. Then all that white briefly turned into a blur on the left sideline, legs firing like pistons. This was the Chris Thompson fans are desperate to see. The Florida State product continues to work his way back from a fractured fibula that ended his 2017 season after 10 games. He’s finally reestablishing himself as a dangerous weapon out of the backfield, particularly in passing situations. Tuesday was the most work Thompson has received in training camp as coaches ease him back on the field. “Was a little nervous just getting out there at first,” Thompson said. “Overall it felt good. As I continued to get going, I kind of got in my groove again and was able to go out and make some plays. I was fine.” [As new helmet rule creates confusion around NFL, Redskins unsure how it will be enforced] Thompson’s best moment Tuesday came on a misdirection screen to the left in which Alex Smith tossed the ball a bit high toward his running back. Thompson was able to tip it to himself, gain control and turn up the sideline. The sight in front of him was green grass — and 300-plus-pound linemen. Thompson later caught a touchdown from Colt McCoy down near the 10-yard line. He came out of the backfield, gave linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons a shimmy to get open and caught a slant to score. “A touchdown,” Thompson replied when asked what he saw on the screen. “O-line did a great job blocking the corner and that was the only guy that was out there. The safety was on the far hash. “I would think in a game-time situation he wouldn’t catch me. But last year I did get caught by [Oakland’s} David Amerson, so I don’t know. I guess I’m not as fast as I thought I was. I think I would’ve had a chance to score on that screen play.” There is a bit of discussion of how fast Thompson is. He appears plenty quick and fast, with that burst he’s known for. He doesn’t necessarily feel that way though. “Little bit, not completely just yet,” Thompson said. “But everybody’s telling me I look fast and I look quick, so I’ll take their word for it. “Like the doctors told me, it’ll probably be 18 months [from the initial injury] before I’m feeling like myself again. If I look good to them right now, I’ll take that.” Thompson expects to continue to be limited at practice, but believes he’ll receive a similar amount of action in the next couple sessions before increasing his workload. The Redskins need him to be a versatile, change-of-pace back, part of an expected 1-2 punch with rookie Derrius Guice, for the offense to reach its potential in 2018. “When you’re talking about your best players Chris and Jordan [Reed] and Trent [Williams] and Morgan [Moses] and some of these guys,” Coach Jay Gruden said before practice, “they got to get out there and practice, but it’s sometimes you just want to treat them like a china doll. You’re like, ‘Oh, please don’t get hit.’ But eventually they’re going to have to put the pads on and practice. “And Chris is getting to a point right now, we’re going to put him in some team periods today, watch the reps he has and the defense will take good care of him because they know what kind of value he has to this football team. But, he’s coming along great and I anticipate him being full go sooner than later.” More on the\\xa0Redskins: Jamison Crowder-Alex Smith connection is starting to flourish Redskins rookie Tim Settle taking advantage of extra opportunities First-round pick Daron Payne out 2-3 weeks with ankle injury Vernon Davis confident in this year’s offense: ‘This is one of the best teams I’ve ever been on’ ', 'Redskins RB Chris Thompson getting his ‘groove’ back as he nears full health - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/rg-iii-had-a-shot-at-the-olympics-but-when-ravens-called-it-was-a-message-from-god/2018/08/01/8116822a-9596-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html': ('Ravens quarterback Robert Griffin III was down to 193 pounds and close to contending for an Olympics spot when Baltimore called to offer him a contract. (Patrick Semansky/AP)   by Sam Fortier August 1 at 12:07 PM Email the author   OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Robert Griffin III stepped to the microphone and grinned at the reporters as if he’d missed this. It was late morning at Under Armour Performance Center and the Baltimore Ravens, his third team in four years, had just finished practice. As Griffin started to respond to a reporter who greeted him, he realized how close the mic was to his mouth. “This is awkward,” he said, flashing his familiar, gaptoothed smile. The grin had been seen rarely since Griffin, for whom the Washington Redskins traded a bounty of draft picks to select second overall in 2012, the year after he won the Heisman Trophy at Baylor, carried Washington to its first playoff appearance in five seasons as a rookie. That year, Griffin’s jersey sold more than any other in the league, and a brand was born: “RG3.” Just a few years later, Griffin had all but vanished from the realm of NFL relevancy. Injuries and a building tension between Griffin and Washington set up an ugly end, and after an injury-shortened season in Cleveland, he was out of the league. At the mic, Griffin tried to distance himself from what happened down the Beltway while facing questions about how he would dig himself out of the rubble of once-great expectations. Ravens Coach John Harbaugh told reporters Griffin’s absence from the game for a year didn’t worry him, that it “wasn’t a very hard” call to sign him and General Manager Ozzie Newsome had decided “pretty quickly.” Griffin, 28, answered with a similar earnestness. He compared being away from football to “someone taking your girl, it gives you an appreciation,” joked about staying in shape by throwing footballs at palm trees, and asserted he was faster than rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson, another speedy Heisman winner who was drafted No. 32 overall in April as the heir apparent to starting quarterback Joe Flacco. In discussing that year away, Griffin never mentioned how much he prepared for life after football — or how the 2020 Olympic Games had come to mind. Griffin understands it will take more than his natural talent for him to make the team. The Ravens have not carried three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster since 2009. He will have his first chance to show everyone what can still do on Thursday, as Baltimore faces Chicago in the Hall of Fame Game at 8 p.m. “Everyone laughs about the sayings I had when I first came into the league, but ‘No pressure, no diamonds’ is one that stuck with me,” Griffin told The Washington Post. “That’s what we said in college. I’ve been under a lot of pressure in my life. I’ve been under a lot of pressure in my NFL career. I’m ready to shine. I think God’s prepared me for it.”    Griffin is likely third on the team’s QB depth chart behind starter Joe Flacco (right) and rookie first-round pick Lamar Jackson (not pictured). (Patrick Semansky/AP)  To listen to Griffin tell it, leaving football “never crossed my mind.” Those around him got a different impression. In the summer of 2017, he was living in Orlando with his second wife, Estonian heptathlete Grete Sadeiko. He received contract offers from Arizona and Baltimore, but neither situation seemed right because of personnel or timing, so he turned them down. Still, though, he trained. “Anyone going through something hard has doubts,” Griffin said, quickly clarifying that he never doubted himself throughout this process. He meant those around him. “My wife would say, ‘Why are you doing this? Why are you running these hills? Why are you throwing these footballs, studying this film? You’re not getting that call. Why keep doing that?’” Last winter, Griffin cold-called a training facility he’d heard of near home and, within a week, he walked into the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. The facility appealed to Griffin because it had football and a track-and-field program, helmed by famous coach Brooks Johnson, who also trained Sadeiko. At Baylor, Griffin ran the 400-meter hurdles all the way to the 2008 Olympic Trials semifinals but left track — even though “at heart, I’m a track guy” — to focus on football. He started to consider a comeback. Griffin split time between the football and track workouts, where he trained alongside Olympians, including Justin Gatlin, the reigning world-champion sprinter who last year outran Usain Bolt for the gold in the 100-meter dash. Griffin, who once weighed more than 225 pounds, had slimmed down to 193. He spoke with Johnson about preparing for the decathlon or the 110-meter hurdles. “He didn’t look at himself as RG3,” Gatlin said. “He looked at himself as Robert. He was hungry, and he had another a shot to get back out there.”     Robert Griffin III took the NFL by storm during his rookie season with the Redskins in 2012. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)     American sprinter Justin Gatlin said that within a year, Griffin would have been seriously contending for a spot in the Olympics. (Jae C. Hong/AP)    For about 10 weeks, Griffin arrived at the facility four days per week at 8:30 a.m. and, over the next five hours, stretched, lifted weights, honed footwork and threw to receivers. Whenever workouts called for speed, he sidled over to Johnson. When asked if track was a plan B, Griffin said he didn’t think so, citing one of his favorite quotes from actor Will Smith: “There’s no reason to have a plan B because it distracts from plan A.” But the track group watched Griffin chip away at his rusty technique. At first, his body launched wide and splayed over the hurdles, but it quickly became tighter. Griffin is 6-foot-2, but Gatlin said football’s emphasis on low centers of gravity conditioned Griffin to run as if he were 5-foot-2. His short strides generated less power. Slowly, Griffin ran straighter, lengthening his legs. The knee injury that hampered his football career seemed to have no effect. Within a year, Gatlin and Johnson said, Griffin would have seriously contended for a spot at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. “He is an Olympic-level talent,” Johnson said. “It didn’t take a lot to get him technically sound.” Then Baltimore called. It was late March, at the beginning of free agency, and Griffin considered it “a message from God” and that “things don’t just happen by accident.” He inked a one-year, $1.1 million deal. In the facility, during stretches and cool-downs, Griffin started bringing index cards made from the Ravens playbook. While they worked out together, Sadeiko quizzed him on the team’s formations and he listed off the personnel. Some people around Griffin attribute his shelving of track, again, to the money at stake in the NFL. For others, it’s deeper. Griffin’s life has seemingly been governed by the same purpose since his uncle signed him up for youth football two decades ago. He was recently told by two global track powers that he’s still got it, and he still returned to the sport where he’s torn his right anterior cruciate ligament twice, dislocated his left ankle once, snapped a bone in his left shoulder and sustained at least two documented concussions. He spent one season as a third-string quarterback, appearing at safety on the practice squad, and another completely away from the game and still, each time, he found it harder to stay away than come back. He does not feel a biological imperative to play football. He feels a religious one. “I know what God’s called me to do,” Griffin said. “He’s called me to play football at a high level, inspire men, lead men. That’s why I didn’t have any doubt in what I was doing.” During a training session in the practice complex earlier this year, football coach Bert Whigham walked by Griffin, who was talking to a player preparing for the NFL Draft. “One day football will be done with you,” Whigham heard Griffin tell the prospect, “but you’ll never be done with football.”    “I know what God’s called me to do,” Griffin said. “He’s called me to play football at a high level, inspire men, lead men. That’s why I didn’t have any doubt in what I was doing.” (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)  On the third day of training camp, Griffin ran off the field, swigged from a water bottle and sank down on his right knee next to his wife on Practice Field 1. After the final whistle blew, Griffin had spent about 20 minutes sprinting and throwing corner routes to the end zone, as he always does. Griffin spoke for about 15 minutes with his wife, whose back rested against the goal post. The fields were otherwise empty. A couple of Ravens staffers and the few fans who weren’t scrunched up behind a yellow rope separating the practice field, mostly young boys, stared at Griffin and his wife, then whispered to one another. A group of fans walked by Griffin, and Griffin obliged the oldest man’s request for a picture and autograph. A few moments later, Flacco walked out of a team-facility door. “Oh my God, oh my God!” one of the boys yelled at his seven friends. “Guys, look who it is!” The boys, and everyone else, rushed to Flacco’s side. They clamored for him to stand next to them for the camera and sign their helmets, balls and jerseys. Hearing the commotion, Griffin turned and saw the mob around Flacco. He stared at the starting quarterback, playing the part that once seemed destined to be his, and his face remained blank.    When the Ravens called, Griffin considered it “a message from God.” (Patrick Semansky/AP)  ', 'RGIII had a shot at the Olympics.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Des Bieler August 1 at 10:40 AM Email the author   Rookies are eternally the shiny new objects in the NFL, but interest in them, particularly for first-round picks, is often out of proportion to their actual on-field production. By contrast, the opposite dynamic is frequently the case in fantasy football, where uncertainty over how large a role a given rookie might have and how well he might perform in it can cause him to slip in drafts. As such, rookies can present very nice draft values for those with the nerve to select them over more proven commodities. Of course, they shouldn’t be selected any higher than makes sense, so here is a guide to when drafters should think about taking the plunge on the top first-year players. For the purposes of this exercise, we’ll assume a 12-team league with PPR scoring. Running Back Saquon Barkley, Giants: First round I am on board with the real draft’s No. 2 overall pick\\xa0going as high as sixth in fantasy drafts, and possibly even higher in .5-PPR and standard formats. He should be in store for 300 touches. [The top fantasy players helped/hurt by offseason movement] Derrius Guice, Redskins: Fourth round The hard-charging back is set for early-down and short-yardage work, with some receiving upside, in a good offense. Ronald Jones, Buccaneers: Fifth round One of the most difficult players to forecast, Jones is likely to lead a committee and offers big-play ability. Sony Michel, Patriots: Fifth round We know New England loves to use a committee at RB, and while Michel has stiff competition for touches in Rex Burkhead and James White, there should be plenty of work to go around in a Tom Brady-led attack. Rashaad Penny, Seahawks: Sixth round Ever-upbeat Pete Carroll’s effusive praise for Chris Carson is less of a concern than Seattle’s general inability to run the ball. [The top five fantasy picks are obvious, but who’s No. 6?] Royce Freeman, Broncos: Eighth round Denver appears determined to keep Devontae Booker heavily involved, with\\xa0De’Angelo Henderson and others also vying for a piece of the pie. Kerryon Johnson, Lions: 10th round Could lose goal line carries to LeGarrette Blount and receptions to Theo Riddick on a team that has long favored the pass. Nick Chubb, Browns: 11th round Might spend the year as Carlos Hyde’s understudy. Nyheim Hines, Colts: 11th round Team wants to use speedy, undersized former WR all over the field, and he could be the primary pass-catching back. Jordan Wilkins, Colts: 13th round Skepticism about Marlon Mack feeds into widespread intrigue around Wilkins. As a late-round flier, he could pay huge dividends. Wide Receiver D.J. Moore, Panthers: 11th round First WR taken in real draft has looked good in training camp but could find consistent targets hard to come by this season. Michael Gallup, Cowboys: 11th round He has a real chance to become the leading receiver amid Dallas’s threadbare WR corps. Anthony Miller, Bears: 13th round Polished prospect is ticketed for a slot role and could see useful volume. Calvin Ridley, Falcons: 13th round Some advocates might be too quick to assume he’ll immediately push past Mo Sanu. Christian Kirk, Cardinals: 15th round Hardly out of the question that he emerges as Arizona’s No. 2 receiver behind Larry Fitzgerald. Tight End Hayden Hurst, Ravens: 16th round He was a first-round pick by a Baltimore team that, with Joe Flacco, has loved to throw to TEs. Mike Gesicki, Dolphins: 16th round Elite athlete pushing for a role in a Miami offense that lost high-percentage target maven Jarvis Landry. Mark Andrews, Ravens; Dallas Goedert, Eagles:\\xa0Two bonus picks here. Both make for decent fliers in very deep leagues. [Your fantasy league would be much better with these settings] Quarterback With the depth at the position, there’s not much reason to even think about these players in single-QB leagues, but in superflex or two-QB formats they could merit some consideration, in this order:  Sam Darnold, Jets: Most likely rookie to win starting job out of training camp. Josh Allen, Bills: Next most likely, but it would be surprising if he didn’t struggle to complete half his throws. Josh Rosen, Cardinals: Sam Bradford is the starter but, of course, is major injury risk. Baker Mayfield, Browns: Backing up Tyrod Taylor for time being, despite being No. 1 overall pick. Lamar Jackson, Ravens: Running ability would make him a hot pickup if he got the chance to start.

But all of those moments were earned through the trial and toil of the past season, one that led to the first title in Washington Capitals franchise history. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Jason Franson/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nBraden Holtby\\nDay 30 | Lashburn, Saskatchewan\\nRoughly 5,000 fans lined up outside the Lashburn Sportsplex in Saskatchewan on Tuesday for the opportunity to snap a photo with hometown hero Braden Holtby and the Stanley Cup, the trophy the Capitals’ netminder had talked about winning since he learned to skate in the tiny farm town of Marshall about 10 miles to the northwest. \\n\\n \\n\\nHoltby signed autographs for three hours at the rink where he first played organized hockey and where a display commemorating his journey from Lashburn to juniors in Saskatoon to the NHL adorns one of the walls. It was the Lloydminster-native’s way of giving back to the place and community that shaped him into the Holtbeast he’s become. \\n“I never really thought twice about it,” Holtby told the My Lloydminster Now website of how he would spend his day with the Cup. “I grew up playing in Lashburn, that’s where I learned how to play and my dad coached basically every team I played for here. It was just a big part of our life growing up. It was nice to bring it back to your roots and I thought the town deserved it.”\\nOn Monday evening, Holtby, who regularly returns to Saskatchewan in the summer, posed for a photo with several family members, including his mom and dad, his wife, Brandi, their two kids, Ben and Belle, and the Stanley Cup in front of a grain elevator in Marshall. \\n\\n \\n\\nIt had been nearly two months since Holtby helped the Capitals clinch their first title in franchise history after an exhilarating postseason run that began with the 2016 Vezina Trophy winner on the bench. Philipp Grubauer outplayed Holtby for much of the regular season and earned the starting nod from Coach Barry Trotz in Washington’s first-round series against Columbus. But after the Capitals fell behind two-games-to-none, Trotz turned to Holtby in search of a spark. Holtby provided one, posting a .935 save percentage and a 1.92 goals-against average in Washington’s next four games, all of them wins. \\nThe soft-spoken and fashion-conscious goalie, who wore a cowboy hat, an unbuttoned shirt over a T-shirt and Birkenstocks on Tuesday, got stronger as the playoffs wore on and was at his best when his team needed him most. With the Capitals facing elimination in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Tampa Bay, Holtby made 24 saves for his first playoff shutout since 2016. Two nights later, he turned away all 29 shots he faced to help the Capitals advance to the Stanley Cup finals for only the second time.\\nHoltby was also responsible for one of the defining moments of the Capitals’ title run -- a play that will be talked about for years to come and, frankly, would look terrific painted on the side of Marshall’s grain elevator or the Lashburn Sportsplex. With Washington protecting a one-goal lead in the waning seconds of Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals, Holtby dove across the crease to stop Alex Tuch’s one-timer, which was bound for the back an apparently wide-open net.\\n\\n\\n\\nBraden Holtby cuts a Stanley Cup cake made by his cousin Janet Rogers, left.

Oshie\\nDay 23 | Warroad, Minnesota\\nT.J. Oshie landed at the small airport in Warroad, Minnesota – also known as Hockeytown, USA – around 9:30 local time on Tuesday morning. A police escort, complete with a community firetruck, waited for him. This was perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Washington Capitals forward to bring the Stanley Cup back to his hometown, and he wanted to do it in style. So he loaded his young family into a 1933 Lincoln limo, top down so he could wave and lift the Cup as the classic car made its way along Highway 33. The town’s massive digital billboard greeted him with a message – “Welcome Home, 77” – and included a photo of Oshie hoisting the cup. Now he was doing it in the flesh. \\nMost of the city’s youth players, along with hundreds of others, arrived at the arena in which Oshie starred in high school to see him with the Cup. The trophy wouldn’t have been there had it not been for one of their favorite sons. Oshie was a cornerstone of the Capitals’ championship run, a run that began with questions of whether or not Oshie was playing hurt. Early in the playoffs, he wasn’t even skating with the team in practices. \\nBut he played in every game. He scored 21 points and displayed a knack for elevating his offense at opportune times. He had six of his 13 goals on power plays alone; he scored goals in two of the final three games of the second-round series win over Pittsburgh, had two goals in a do-or-die Game-6 win over Tampa Bay in the Eastern Conference Finals and a goal and an assist in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals against Vegas. Those were crucial performances. Moreover, it was his usual feistiness and countless big hits that set the tone for a team that simply wouldn’t be denied.\\n\\n \\n\\nThere were other memorable moments off the ice during the run; Oshie endeared himself with his fan base by riding Washington’s Metro to Game 3 and 4 of the final series. He emotionally paid tribute to his father, who coached him growing up and has been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s, on the Vegas ice after the team won the Cup. And he was one of the more colorful personalities during the celebration back in Washington, making a habit out of chugging beers through the filter of his jersey pulled over his face, including as he delivered his address after the title parade. The party continued on Tuesday in Warroad. \\nCitizens from his community drank from the Cup. He held a toast for everyone who had shown up at a local bar, raising his Bud Light with a wide smile on his face. He stopped by the town’s water tower, emblazoned with two hockey sticks and considered something of a monument. He reminisced with his old friend Gigi Marvin, a gold-medalist with the U.S. Olympic women’s hockey team and who, along with Oshie, had been named royalty at the 2005 Warroad Frosty Festival, when both were still in high school. He sat down at one point to eat Cap’n Crunch out of the Cup. \\nHe planned to take the Cup to Minneapolis later in the day to share with teammates Shane Gersich and Travis Boyd, but before he returned to the small airport, he posed for countless more photos. That included one with the town’s mayor, who officially and proudly declared Tuesday, July 24, as “T.J. Oshie Day.” \\nRead more\\nBack to top\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (Washington Capitals)\\n\\nMatt Niskanen\\nDay 21 | Virginia, Minnesota\\nFans began arriving up at Miners Memorial Building in Virginia, Minnesota just after sunrise on Sunday morning, and soon hundreds more raced to get a spot in line to see one of their hometown sons hold the Stanley Cup. Matt Niskanen had learned to play hockey at this facility, first in pee-wee and then in high school, so it only made sense that this would be the first stop for the Washington Capitals defenseman on his day with the Cup. \\nNiskanen wore a gray shirt with black shorts and black hat, almost blending in as he shook hands with countless citizens from the community. He had already shown an ability to relate to his fans during the Stanley Cup run during the spring, when he rode Washington’s Metro to Game 3 along with teammate and fellow Minnesota native T.J. Oshie; that only endeared him more with a fan-base that already recognized how valuable he was on the ice. \\nNiskanen was not only a centerpiece of Washington’s markedly improved defense during the postseason – but he also embodied the Capitals’ willingness to outwork teams down the stretch. One of his signature moments came at the end of the second period in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals against Vegas, when he outhustled the Golden Knights and created a short-handed breakaway. He was tripped by Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury on his way to the net, earning a penalty and providing a momentum-altering sequence in his team’s 3-1 win. His teammate, Jay Beagle, would later call him “our rock back there.” \\nWashington wouldn’t lose another game in the series, in large part because Niskanen – who also produced one goal and eight assists during the playoffs -- helped galvanize a roster that checked and blocked shots at every turn. It only made sense that he was gifted with the key to his hometown on Sunday.\\nAfter he was done posing for photos and taking the Cup to the middle of the arena at Miners Memorial Building, he eventually returned home and watched his young son, Charlie, use it as a bowl for some fruit snacks. \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter a decade of chasing the Stanley Cup – he had lost both in the Western Conference Finals with the Dallas Stars during his rookie year in 2008 and in the Eastern Conference Finals with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2013 before enduring several years of postseason heartbreak with the Capitals – Niskanen spent one of his final moments with the cup on the banks of Lake Vermillion, lifting the trophy over his head as the sun set, finally a champion. — Roman Stubbs\\n\\nRead more\\nBack to top\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (Washington Capitals)\\n\\nJakub Vrana\\nDay 10 | Prague, Czech Republic\\nThe night that ended with the Washington Capitals lifting the Stanley Cup began with a goal from Jakub Vrana. The speedy Czech winger skated down the left-center of the ice on a breakaway, then sniped a wrist shot over the glove of Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury. The goal put Washington ahead 1-0, a just reward for a player who had created numerous scoring chances throughout the Stanley Cup finals.\\nThat moment, and that night, triggered a chain reaction that helped introduce the Prague native to fans in his new home of Washington. On the Capitals’ first weekend back with the Cup, Vrana’s Instagram story helped detail much of the beer-drenched celebration – and provided a look at his new Stanley Cup tattoo. He further \\nendeared himself to fans\\n during the parade by shotgunning a beer from the top of a tour bus and professing his love for the fanbase during an impromptu radio interview conducted on a phone flung into that bus.\\nVrana both toned down and classed up his drinking when he reclaimed the Cup in his home city, most notably when he sprayed champagne into a crowd and eventually his mouth at a rally near the ice rink where he learned the game.\\nEarlier in the day he hosted a private gathering with friends and family at a favorite restaurant, the Cup sitting on a table surrounded by wide-bodied Bohemian beer mugs and trays of food. From there, Vrana and his mother brought the trophy to the cemetery in which his grandmother was laid to rest.\\nHe also squeezed in a trip to the hockey shooting range – a large rectangle of netting with a goal-sized yellow frame – where he refined his shot outside his apartment. It was that shot that gave the Capitals an early lead in the decisive game of the Stanley Cup finals.\\nVrana capped his time with the trophy at a Prague night club before it was shipped back to North America to continue its tour.

The 27-year-old was in just his second NHL season, and his career in the league was on life support. He was already considering returning to Europe and to play. \\nBut then he was traded to the Capitals in exchange for a third-round pick before the Feb. 26 trade deadline, and his smooth skating helped solidify what had been a porous Washington defense.

Its bearer wore jeans, a black polo and a flat-brimmed NHL All-Star Game cap as he strode toward the gated entrance with a small entourage circling him — makeshift security. But despite his otherwise nondescript appearance, the hulking chalice made Alex Ovechkin unmistakable, one of Russia’s most recognizable athletes carrying hockey’s grandest trophy to his country’s most iconic spot.\\nHe immediately was swarmed as people tried to shove their way through the cameras following him to touch the trophy or the man. They pleaded for a photo or an autograph. They yelled their congratulations. “Great job, Sanya!” some shouted, calling him by his Russian nickname. \\n“Alex Ovechkin is in Red Square with the Stanley Cup,” one woman frantically whispered into her cellphone as she tried to keep up with his brisk strides.\\nWith St. Basil’s Cathedral in the background, Ovechkin stopped, and his agent and a Washington Capitals spokesman attempted to keep the crowd back.

He then hoisted the Stanley Cup above his head to the sound of cheers. Phones followed the Cup up to get the shot of Ovechkin finally returning home with the prize so many expected he would claim one day. \\nIt has been a month since the Capitals won their first Stanley Cup championship, and in a weekend 13 years in the making, Ovechkin was awarded two days with the Stanley Cup in his hometown, a tradition for the winning team’s captain. For one of Moscow’s most beloved sons, it represented a prophecy fulfilled.\\n“I wanted to be the guy who brings the Cup,” said Ovechkin, who had promised as much as recently as last summer.\\nOvechkin returned Saturday to the Dynamo hockey club facility where he played as a teenager and where there’s a large photo of him in the main lobby that he signed, “Thanks for everything.” When Ovechkin was 14, Hall of Famer Igor Larionov, who won three Stanley Cups with the Detroit Red Wings, visited Dynamo and spoke of his career and his championships.\\nAs Ovechkin walked around his old locker room a year ago, he told Dynamo Coach Vladimir Vorobiev that he would be back with the Stanley Cup and they would drink beer together. On Saturday, Ovechkin had the Stanley Cup to his left with a tray of food on his right as his van pulled up to the training center, an arch with light blue and white balloons and a pedestal for the trophy awaiting his arrival at the front of the building. He went through the back entrance for a few quiet moments. This was where he ran laps after every practice and “hated it,” Ovechkin said, still able to picture his father sitting on the bench watching him. \\n\\n\\n\\nAlex Ovechkin kisses his father, Mikhail. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\\n\\nHis father, Mikhail, was present Saturday as well, mingling outside and posing for photos with some of the large crowd that had gathered to see Ovechkin bring the trophy home. Ovechkin grabbed the 35-pound cup and waited by the door, lifting it for Mikhail to touch as he walked in.\\nThey then hoisted it together.\\n“Kiss it,” Ovechkin told him. \\n“We waited 13 years,” Mikhail said after planting a smooch on the silver.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe night Ovechkin and the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas, Mikhail had been watching the game at the family’s country home in the Moscow suburbs. With the NHL app on his phone, he watches his son’s every game — and later the highlights — from the dining room television. Ovechkin typically calls his parents before every game, but despite the late hour in Moscow, he called Mikhail after Washington’s championship-clinching Game 5 win against Vegas. He told his father he loved him and he was thankful for everything he did to help him reach that point.\\n“It was something he was dreaming about,” Alex said. “That’s why he give so much help, so much of his time to me and it’s all about that.”\\n“I can’t even put it into words,” Mikhail said. “Thirteen years we were working toward that goal, and finally to win the Stanley Cup, it’s a huge happiness. Huge happiness.”\\nThe younger Ovechkin later carried the trophy up the stairs, where Dynamo has its museum. The signed jerseys and sticks of notable former players are in glass cases, and Ovechkin immediately picked out Capitals teammate Nicklas Backstrom’s display from when they played there together during the 2012-13 NHL lockout. \\nWith the Stanley Cup still in his grasp, he turned in place as his eyes scanned the room, perhaps considering that a photo of him visiting with the Stanley Cup soon would be proudly displayed. After he told a group of kids in Dynamo jerseys to follow their dreams and then posed for photos with the Stanley Cup, Ovechkin laced up skates and carried the trophy onto the rink where he once practiced, hoisting it up as someone on the bench warned him not to fall because the blades were dull. He then returned to the locker room, set the Stanley Cup down and clinked frosted mugs with Vorobiev.\\n“You know, Alex is a big star,’ Vorobiev said. “When he’s young, every guy who play with him, is working with him, he know he’s going to be a big star.”\\nThe Stanley Cup made its first voyage to Russia in 1997, the summer that Detroit won with five Russians, and Pittsburgh Penguins center Evgeni Malkin brought the trophy to Moscow the past two summers. But perhaps no player had higher hopes placed on him than Ovechkin, the first overall pick in 2004 who became one of the greatest goal scorers in NHL history. He first saw the trophy when he visited Toronto’s Hockey Hall of Fame as a Capitals rookie. Apparently unconcerned with superstition, he touched it.\\n“I knew one day we would win it,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlex Ovechkin posed with more than 3,000 fans at the World Cup Fan Fest as he toured his hometown with the Stanley Cup.

He set it on a table as he passed through a metal detector for a gathering of fans at the Moscow State University campus, there for a viewing party of Russia’s World Cup quarterfinal soccer game against Croatia. As he lifted it above his head for the crowd, one man yelled to him, “We’ve been waiting for you our entire lives.”\\nOvechkin posed for more than 3,000 photos as part of an event organized by the Putin Team, a social media movement Ovechkin started in November to support Russian President Vladi\\xadmir Putin.

He’s been waiting for this Cup for a long, long time.”\\nAfter a hectic and public first day with the trophy, Ovechkin chose to make Sunday more private. He took the Stanley Cup to a closed hockey game with high-ranking government officials, including Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev — but not Putin. He visited his family’s childhood apartment, laying with the trophy on the twin bed he used to sleep in. Then he and his parents went to the cemetery where his older brother, Sergey, rests after he died of a blood clot after a car accident when Ovechkin was 10. The Stanley Cup minders stayed in the car as Ovechkin carried the trophy to the headstone.\\n“It’s hard,” Ovechkin said. “But I think it was very important for me personally because he’s my brother obviously.

He wanted it to stay in Washington, choosing to whisk the chalice from the Bethesda Firehouse to Children’s National Medical Center to a fundraiser in Bethesda before ending the night with a private party at Salt Line in Navy Yard.\\nIt was all very fitting for the 28-year-old who was drafted by the Capitals a decade ago. He has since met his wife Gina in Washington, started a family here and settled here, the only player who continues to live and train here for the duration of the offseason. He had already endeared himself to the area with a career year — 15 goals and 53 assists to lead all NHL defensemen in scoring during the regular season and five goals with 20 assists in the playoffs — but nine days after Carlson signed an eight-year, $64 million extension with the team, he further cemented himself as a true Washingtonian.\\n“I think everyone around and my family is going to celebrate it the same no matter where I was, but it’s nice to be able to enjoy it with the fans as well and to do pretty special stuff like this,” Carlson said.\\nThe Carlsons’s pediatrician is on the board at Children’s National, so they’ve felt a connection there and offered to bring by the Stanley Cup just 10 days earlier.

If the Caps can do it, if anybody can do it, we can, too. It just really has that kind of lift and appeal. Yeah, it’s hockey and it’s sports, but when you think about how that team came together and the city’s come together, Children’s National is proud to be part of it.”\\nCarlson was born in Massachusetts and played his youth hockey in New Jersey, but after his visit to the hospital, Carlson took the Stanley Cup to his Chevy Chase neighborhood, walking down the street to a yard where a small crowd had gathered to touch it and take photos with it. A five-minute drive away, a fundraising party had already started in downtown Bethesda to benefit the Michael Mosier Defeat DIPG Foundation, which raises awareness and provides research funding to treat aggressive brain tumors that targets children. Standard tickets were $20 each, and a line snaked under a tent to take photos with Carlson before he even arrived. The event ultimately raised more than $100,000 for Carlson’s cause.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn Carlson shows off the Stanley Cup to his neighbors in Chevy Chase, Md.

We’re all enjoying ourselves and raising a lot of money, so that’s kind of the best of both worlds.”\\nThe Stanley Cup got a respite from the heat at Carlson’s home, posted next to his sleeping son Rudy — appropriately born during the postseason — before a final stop on Washington’s Southeast Waterfront. Patrons surrounded the outdoor bar at Salt Line when a bus pulled up and the crowd that was inside for a private party emptied out of the restaurant with their phones raised for photos.

(John Locher/Associated Press)   by Tim Bontemps August 1 at 7:00 AM Email the author   Much has been made of the course the Houston Rockets have plotted this summer. Coming off a season in which the Rockets lead the NBA with 65 victories and pushed the Golden State Warriors to seven games in the Western Conference finals, Houston was expected to bring back largely the same team for another shot at the now two-time defending champions. Things haven’t quite gone that way. Yes, Chris Paul and Clint Capela were re-signed, as Houston locked up its top two free agents to long-term deals. But Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute — both key cogs to Houston’s success last season — left in free agency, signing with the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Clippers, respectively. The players Houston signed to replace them — Michael Carter-Williams, James Ennis and, once he clears waivers Wednesday afternoon, Carmelo Anthony — feel like either awkward fits for how the Rockets play, or simply not the same caliber of talent as Ariza and Mbah a Moute. That Carter-Williams, Ennis and Anthony together have a salary cap hit of about $4.5 million — compared to the $15 million Ariza got from Phoenix and the $4.3 million Mbah a Moute received from Los Angeles — makes it hard to ignore the likelihood they weren’t retained because of luxury tax concerns alone. But when the question of whether Houston has taken a step back was posed to James Harden, the NBA’s reigning most valuable player, he didn’t hesitate: Absolutely not. “No. You can go back to articles and conversations and people said, ‘Me and Chris can’t play together.’ [Then] we were the number one [team] in the NBA,” Harden said with a laugh after Team USA practice last week. “Obviously, you can look at a roster and look at different players and say that. But you have to be on that court and you’ve got to be in the trenches and be in the war. “Eventually we will figure it out. We have enough leadership in that locker room and a great coaching staff to figure that out.” Whether the Rockets have taken a step back or not, it is obvious that if Houston is going to come anywhere near replicating the success it had last year, it’s going to have to do so in a different way. From the first day of training camp last season, the Rockets built their team around a switching defense that emphasized its ability to have anyone on the court guard anyone else at any time. It was a defense specifically wired to try to stop the Warriors — and, if Paul hadn’t blown out his hamstring in the final minute of Game 5 of the Western Conference finals, or if the Rockets hadn’t missed 27 straight three-pointers in Game 7, it might have accomplished its goal. But even if one could argue Ariza, now 33, has lost a step, or that Mbah a Moute could be a risk moving forward after dislocating his shoulder twice last season, replacing them won’t be easy. Ennis is the kind of piece of raw clay that Rockets Coach Mike D’Antoni has molded into an impact player in the past, but he’s never come close to providing the kind of impact at either end as Ariza and Mbah a Moute have. Anthony, on the other hand, is coming off a season with the Oklahoma City Thunder in which he struggled to be a third option behind Russell Westbrook and Paul George — precisely the kind of role he will be playing in Houston. And, for all of his offensive gifts, Anthony has never been known as a defensive stopper. There is a method to Houston’s madness, though — at least in the eyes of Eric Gordon, the other Rocket who was part of Team USA’s mini camp last week. It all goes back to that Game 7, and specifically Houston’s inability to make anything from deep over the final three quarters of that game. If Houston had more of an offensive spark, things could have been a lot different. “I still think we’re going to be a championship-caliber team, for sure,” Gordon said. “We did lose two dynamic guys that are really good defenders for us [Ariza and Mbah a Moute], really versatile guys. [But we] brought in guys that are also versatile, but more on the offensive side. “We’re still going to be really good. When you look at that Warriors series, we just needed a little bit more scoring a little bit. We just hit a couple more threes, it would’ve been different even with guys injured. So we’re still in good position.” The counterpoint to that is when Houston did try to deploy an offensive-first player in that Game 7 by playing Ryan Anderson in the third quarter, the Warriors promptly attacked him repeatedly, went on a quick 14-2 run and swung the game decisively in their favor. Still, the Rockets deserve the benefit of the doubt after the season they had. The same goes for General Manager Daryl Morey, who always seems to have a trick up his sleeve. One thing Houston won’t be lacking in, however, is motivation. After the way the West finals played out — with the Rockets, even without Paul, leading at halftime of both Games 6 and 7, before dropping both games — Harden said he hasn’t been able to let it go. “That was a good feeling,” Harden said of winning the league’s MVP award, “but that feeling that I had in that Western Conference finals, with basically one half to go … I need that feeling back. I’ll try to work my butt off, and mentally lock in as much as I can to get back to that feeling. “Like, you are right there. You’re a half away, and then something, just a roadblock hits you and you have to find a way to get past that roadblock. We couldn’t get past that roadblock. It was just too tough. “We’ve got to get back there.” For the next nine months or so, the focus will be on whether the moves the Rockets made this summer will allow them to — or whether Houston let its best chance at a title slip away this past season, done in by Paul’s balky hamstring and all those wayward three-pointers. Just don’t expect Harden to agree with that assessment. “What we have right now is for sure good enough,” he said. “We have to realize nothing changes for us. You’ve got to realize: that was me and Chris’s first year together. Guys were asking, ‘Can they play together? How is that going to work?’ We made it work, and it was easy. “Once training camp hits, we’ll work our butts off, and every single day we’ll just continue to get better and keep chopping away.” Read more: LeBron James: Trump has used sports ‘to divide us’ After procedures on knee and elbow, Paul George is ‘comfortable’ and looking like his old self Jerry Colangelo, one of the NBA’s elder statesmen, talks Team USA, the 76ers and more Rockets become the center of attention on final day of Team USA minicamp The contentious relationship between Kevin Durant and NBA Twitter continues Ted Leonsis projects Wizards as possibly the ‘deepest team that we’ve ever had’ ', 'James Harden laughs off talk that Rockets took a step back this summer - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/my-heart-its-never-been-fuller-all-black-team-wins-dc-little-league-title/2018/07/25/2061c35c-904d-11e8-8322-b5482bf5e0f5_story.html': ('by Barry Svrluga Sports columnist July 25 Email the author    On Tuesday night, while the Washington Nationals were losing yet another game in an increasingly dreary summer, a much more important baseball development took place on a little diamond in an out-of-the-way corner of the District. A ball pinged off an aluminum bat, then thudded into a glove. And then delirium — hats in the air, gloves tossed to the side, hugs all around. “It’s honestly overwhelming,” said Keith Barnes, the president of the Mamie Johnson Little League. “My heart,” said Charlie Sperduto, who directs the baseball and softball programs at the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, “it’s never been fuller than it was last night.” The transactional information isn’t mind-blowing: Mamie Johnson beat Capitol Hill to win the District’s Little League championship. The tournament has been held annually for 31 years. Someone has to win it. Next stop for the 12 boys from Mamie Johnson: Bristol, Conn., for regionals, with the Little League World Series in sight beyond that. That result, though, is enormously important not just for those kids and coaches but for baseball in Washington and beyond, too. This is the first all-African American team to win this tournament. Think about that and then listen to Barnes, who played high school and college ball — and wants other kids like him to one day say the same. “I got tired of reading articles about the decline of African Americans in baseball,” he said Wednesday morning. “And no one had solutions.”    Next stop for the 12 boys from Mamie Johnson: Bristol, Conn., for regionals, with the Little League World Series in sight beyond that. (Mamie Johnson Little League/Mamie Johnson Little League)  Guess what? He’s now part of the solution. This shouldn’t be happening. Not yet anyway. Five years ago, there was no Little League program in the District’s Ward 7, which is almost entirely east of the Anacostia River. Five years ago, the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy hadn’t opened its gleaming facility in the heart of that ward. Five years ago, baseball not only had almost no participation here, it really had no presence. “People were interested, but they didn’t really know how to cheer at a baseball game or how to act or where to stand,” said Raphael Lockett, who is in his third year coaching with Mamie Johnson and served as the head coach for the new champs, made up of 11- and 12-year-olds. “They called umpires ‘refs,’ stuff like that. Now they’re telling me, ‘Hey, Coach, why don’t you hit-and-run here?’ They’re going through situational baseball. They’re all into it, lights out.” Major League Baseball, you need to pay attention to what happened here Tuesday night. The Major League Baseball Players Association? Yep, you too. This isn’t just about one group of kids who won one tournament over one week. This is about the future of the sport. And it’s not about rolling out some bats and balls and saying, “Look! We’re supporting baseball in inner cities!” This is about a community-wide commitment to use baseball not just for baseball’s sake but to develop youth that might not otherwise be developed. In the short-term, the kids benefit from baseball. Years from now, baseball could be the beneficiary. “We have to fill the funnel,” said Tal Alter, the only executive director in Nationals Academy history and the character whose vision and commitment made a scene such as Tuesday night’s possible.    “It’s honestly overwhelming,” said Keith Barnes, the president of the Mamie Johnson Little League, said of the squad’s title. (Mamie Johnson Little League/Mamie Johnson Little League)  Alter and his staff are trying to fill that funnel with a fire hose. There are 700 kids in the academy’s “YBA Play” program, which provides fast-paced, nontraditional entry points in the sport that have helped kids get hooked. Eight of the 12 players on the Mamie Johnson team are academy kids, coming for holistic education programs after school during the academic year — STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and literacy education but baseball as well — and then spending their summer days at the facility. “They’re in that baseball culture like every day,” Barnes said. “That made it easier from those kids to buy in to what we’re doing.” What they’re doing — together — is saving a sport in the city. Barnes used the academy as ground zero to start his league from scratch, even though he has no kids of his own and wouldn’t be paid a dime. They started with 120 kids in 2015. This year, 310 registered. Barnes and his founding partners named the league in honor of Mamie “Peanut” Johnson, the first female pitcher to play in the Negro Leagues who happened to reside in Washington. It was a nod to history. But they were thinking of the generation to come. “When I watched baseball, I didn’t really understand it,” said 12-year-old Josh Young, the team cutup. “But I wanted to try it, to try and figure it out.” That became part of the mission for Alter, Sperduto and the academy staff. Sperduto teaches fundamentals by modifying rules, trying to suck kids into the sport. To fill the funnel, they need kids such as Solomon McKinney. Two years ago, he was obsessed with basketball and had never put on a baseball glove. On Tuesday night in the championship game, he tripled off the outfield fence. “He went from bouncing the ball,” Sperduto said, “to pounding the mitt.” But it isn’t just the pulls of basketball and football — or even video games and iPhones — that they’re battling. It’s the circumstances of their section of the city. “We’ve had setbacks after setbacks,” said Sperduto, a former college baseball player who has been with the academy since before the facility opened its doors. “Some kids have moved out, and we’ve lost some kids who had great potential because of family challenges. But our team here is relentlessly positive. We believe.” Package all that up, and there’s a chance for something special to happen not only for these families and these kids when they take the field again Aug. 5. This can be a model for other major league teams to use their brand and their brawn to reignite the sport in areas where, we have been told over and over, it’s dying. In 2017, African Americans made up just 7.1 percent of MLB’s Opening Day roster spots — the lowest percentage since 1958. (The figure jumped to 7.8 percent this year.) This is a socioeconomic problem because baseball is expensive and has become a white, suburban sport. The Youth Development Foundation sponsored by MLB and the players’ union believes enough in what the Nationals Academy is doing that it gave it $1\\xa0million over three years. But is that intractable? For the championship game, the academy’s rooftop was littered with tents that shielded an overflow crowd from the showers. The sidewalks were packed. Fans sat on the hills behind the outfield walls. They brought noise makers. Supporters from other leagues around the city came to see whether Mamie Johnson could pull it off. “That’s the biggest crowd I’ve ever seen,” said Langston Speed, also 12 and a middle infielder. Just that scene matters. Since Mamie Johnson formed, since the academy opened, a critical mass of kids has shown that there’s an appetite for baseball in just the kind of neighborhood where it had seemed to dry up. But winning? Winning matters, too. Last year, some of the Mamie Johnson kids were part of a team that lost in the D.C. final, blowing a four-run lead in the final inning. Johnson herself was there to see it. “Our guys came to the moment,” Lockett said, “and it was too much.” Over the winter, Johnson died at 82. So on Tuesday night, the kids from her namesake Little League began the most important game of their young lives by cheering, “For Mamie!” They wear little peanut patches on their uniforms. And this year, they won. The foundation is there. If it’s to grow, the result mattered. “We’ve had young kids already come up, parents already come up, from 5 to 7 years old saying, ‘I want to be that team. What can we do? Where’s the league sign-up? How can we play?’” Lockett said. “ ‘How can I play with my kids? What drills are you working on?’ It’s not, ‘Where’s the basketball goal?’ It’s, ‘Can I buy a bat for next year?

(David ‘Dee’ Delgado/ for The Washington Post)   by Rick Maese July 28 Email the author   NEW YORK — When the last Philadelphia hero had been eliminated and left motionless on the animated map, the players removed their hands from the controls, confetti fluttered through the air and triumphant music blasted through the public-address system at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Fans were on their feet cheering, hoisting their smart phones to record the moment: the first championship of the Overwatch League. The London Spitfire toppled the underdog Philadelphia Fusion on Saturday afternoon, an important mile-marker for a first-year league that began play in January with designs on revolutionizing the way esports is played, structured and consumed. The confetti, the costumed fans, the raucous atmosphere – it was as much part of the OWL dream as it was the league’s blueprint. Saturday marked the culmination of the inaugural season, and while the upstart league has touted it as a huge success, it was only a step. The looming transition to the local markets will ultimately define the success of not just the league but also whether its ambitious model can truly reshape the esports landscape. “The city-based format has really taken off in a faster and in a bigger way than I had expected,” said Nate Nanzer, the league commissioner, “and, frankly, like I knew it would work — for all the reasons that work in traditional sports. I just thought it would maybe take more time.” The league (OWL) wasn’t built to be a get-rich-quick scheme. It aims to have the staying power and popularity of traditional sports leagues like the NBA or NFL, connecting with communities the way the New York Yankees or New England Patriots do, and producing revenues that blur the line between games and sports. [With Overwatch League Grand Finals, esports takes over Brooklyn to the roar of thunderous applause] “I think it is still a long-term play. One year in a sports league is immaterial,” said Jonathan Kraft, president of the Kraft Group, which owns the OWL’s Boston Uprising franchise and also the New England Patriots. “We did this with an eye towards building long-term asset value.” Long before Saturday’s championship formally brought the inaugural season to a close, OWL officials had been busy plotting out Season 2 and beyond. ESPN reported recently that the league is finalizing agreements with three expansion franchises – one in Atlanta, one in Paris and another in Guangzhou, China – and as many as three more could be on the way, each selling for $30-60 million. And while the league’s most fervent fans are accustomed to following OWL games via the live-streaming video service Twitch, the league also signed a broadcast deal this month that will put future matches on ESPN and Disney channels. While the league’s online numbers exceeded expectations for many team executives – the broadcasts averaged anywhere from 80,000 to 170,000 concurrent viewers — team and league officials feel certain their Year 1 successes are only a preview of what’s to come. They think the league is still rolling down the runway, and though there are some potential obstacles ahead, they feel they’re following a blueprint that will revolutionize esports. “If Overwatch League is successful, it’s inherently changed the model for every publisher, for every league and for every team that exists in the world,” said Noah Whinston, the chief executive of the Los Angeles Valiant franchise. “Having a localized model at this scale has never been attempted before. If this league is successful, I think it throws a lot of conventional wisdom about esports completely off the table.”   350k viewers on @Twitch - you better bet that 400k was easily within reach if this went the distance, maybe even half a million. Still, have to imagine that + ESPN + Disney is a great result.— Ben Goldhaber (@FishStix) July 28, 2018    A global league’s local vision The two squads of players sat on a stage at one end of the arena, dwarfed by the giant video scoreboard overhead. The favored London Spitfire squad consisted of six Korean gamers, all of whom would be carded by any bartender in Brooklyn, and the Philadelphia Fusion featured six players from five different countries. None of the players on the stage was American and none had any tangible connection to the city he’d been representing these past four months. The novelty of OWL is its geolocating model in which the 12 franchises are tied to specific cities, just like traditional sports leagues. It’s a novel formula and based on the early returns, Blizzard, the game’s publisher, could eventually use the same approach with other titles, most notably Call of Duty, a popular esports title for the past dozen years. [ESPN secures Overwatch League broadcast rights, continuing esports’ mainstream surge] But in Year 1 of OWL, all the teams were actually located in the Los Angeles area, playing their matches at the same 450-seat Burbank, Calif., studio that formerly hosted “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.” That will be the Year 2 arrangement too. But owners are hopeful that in Year 3 – 2020 – the teams will relocate to their actual cities, which will open up new revenue streams. A report from the market research company Newzoo earlier this year suggested global esports revenues will top $900 million this year and will nearly double in the next three years. The OWL teams know that money is out there, which is why franchise rights for the initial 12 teams sold for $20 million apiece. “Ultimately, to really be a force — to create the types of monetization that you’d like to have on a local basis, the team has to be in-market more regularly,” Kraft said.    Fans of London Spitfire celebrate the win (David ‘Dee’ Delgado/For The Washington Post)  The league sought out owners who have experience in traditional sports, who understand cultivating an audience in a local market. The OWL owners include the Kraft family, Fred Wilpon, who owns the New York Mets, and Stan Kroenke, who owns the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Rams. But with the squads representing cities in name only, there’s only so much they can do with that knowledge. Teams have hosted watch parties and tried to generate local media interest but opportunities are inherently limited. Estimates suggest as many as 150 million people watch esports globally, a figure that is expected to only grow in coming years. But the league wants a particularly avid following to bloom in the league’s hand-picked cities. They can then leverage that fandom and create revenue streams: ticket sales, merchandising, local sponsorships, community partnerships. “I think monetization is the core issue in esports,” Whinston said. “We all know how big the audience is. … We’re still a long way away from generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue on an annual basis, but I think we’ve made the right steps to start proving out the different pieces to the model.” [Overwatch League’s Grand Finals provide a crucial esports lesson: Adapt or die] Kraft likens the league’s Season 1 core audience to low-hanging fruit, largely gamers who didn’t need much arm-twisting. The challenge down the road will be growing beyond that. “I think to start to attract and educate casual fans and bring the geographic connection in — I think of people who don’t love hockey but say, ‘The Bruins are my team because they live in Boston,’” he said. “I think you have to be in-market to fully take advantage of that.” “Once it comes into the market, those less-than-avid fans then have a reason to start paying attention. That’s when we’ll really have to kick it into high gear,” he continued. “Look, the league launched very successfully, no one can dispute that. … And we’ll just get stronger next year. But the next real big test will be when we go in-market in 2020.”    Cosplayers dressed as their favorite characters in Overwatch for the first-ever finals (David ‘Dee’ Delgado/For The Washington Post)  Can a game become a pastime? Overwatch, barely two years old, already has a loyal following. The fans who flooded Brooklyn – many of whom lined up hours before the Barclay Center doors opened — wore gear representing all 12 of the league’s teams, many featuring the names of specific players across their shoulders. Many others came dressed in costume as the game’s heroes – Sombra, Zarya, Widowmaker and even Wrecking Ball, a new hamster character introduced last month, among them — and seemed to connect with the characters in the game as much as the players using them. In the arena, the players sat mostly still on the stage, their hands doing all the work unseen, their heads shielded from the crowd by monitors. Most of the action took place on the gigantic videoboard overhead. Overwatch is a six-on-six shooter game, a futuristic adventure that is both the reason for the league’s instant success and perhaps a slight cause for trepidation. Even as the league took off this spring, many gamers started gravitating this year to another title. Fortnite became undoubtedly the game of the moment, reportedly topping 125 million players and bringing in $1 million a day. “What Fortnite has done is absolutely incredible,” said Tucker Roberts, president of the Fusion franchise. “It’s pulling fans right now from Overwatch, League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike — all the biggest games that have been around for years. It’s no joke. … But I don’t think that will persist forever.” Fortnite and its battle royale format don’t lend itself to a team-based league, and OWL officials are quick to point out that there are always new titles. Even if some temporarily siphon off players, the good games — think: StarCraft, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Warcraft – tend to have staying power. [Are pro athletes playing too much Fortnite? Some teams are worried.] “From my perspective, the fears of esports fads and games coming in and out of favor is a little overblown,” said Whinston. “Of course, there are casual fans that will move from game to game, but I think it’s overly simplistic to say, ‘Well, a new game will come along and Overwatch will fall out of popularity.’” The key is evolution. Updates, new maps, new characters, new technology. And unlike traditional sports, esports has the ability to tweak its games at any time, even during a season. Blizzard makes regular Overwatch updates and this year even introduced a new character midway through the season, which forced teams to change strategies and upended the league hierarchy. As a result, the best regular-season team, the New York Excelsior, was ousted in the OWL semifinals. The Fusion, which sneaked into the playoffs with the sixth and final roster spot, instead found itself in Brooklyn this weekend. While baseball or football would never fundamentally alter its rule book midway through the season, OWL officials seemed to embrace a drastic midseason change that forced players to adapt. “I think there’s a lot of traditional sports that are struggling to keep fans engaged and engage with young fans because they haven’t evolved in 100 years,” Nanzer said. “And so I think that’s an advantage that we have over traditional sports.”    The championship trophy for the first Overwatch League finals. (David ‘Dee’ Delgado/For The Washington Post)  Building on the foundation The league said it sold out the approximately 11,000 available seats for the two-day finals. Any fans searching the secondary market for tickets last week were paying at least $125 to get into the arena. DJ Khaled performed before the day’s main event and for the next 75 minutes, all eyes were glued the videoboard. Down below cameras fluttered about, zooming in tight on the players. It was all broadcast live globally on Twitch and scheduled to re-air during prime time on ESPN2. The linear broadcast deal is regarded as a big step for the young league. It not only validated esports’ place on the North American sports landscape, but it has the potential to help broaden OWL’s reach. Team executives know gamers are comfortable turning to Twitch but feel there’s also a potential audience that’s more accustomed to traditional cable. (Twitch is owned by Amazon, whose founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) “Your core fan base might not go there, but their parents and their family and friends may,” said the Fusion’s Roberts, who’s the son of Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts. It could potentially help mainstream the sport in a way where discussion isn’t relegated to online portals, college dorm rooms or school hallways. It could be discussed on sports talk radio, featured on SportsCenter and debated at the office water cooler. Its audience wouldn’t merely be those who play Overwatch themselves.

Think about it this way, nobody would say you need to play baseball in order to be a baseball fan. I believe what we’re building is kind of a social and cultural movement.” The way team and league executives see it, they jumped into a business where the market was already in place with a built-in audience that was hungry for an engaging product. And OWL officials are counting on them being around for awhile. “Have you met a 12-year old recently?” Nanzer asks. “Because if you have, I’m guessing all they do is watch other people play video games on Twitch and YouTube. And that’s not going to magically change when they turn 35. It’s not like they’re going to turn 35 and be like, ‘Well, I’m a baseball fan now.’” They hope the party inside of Barclays Saturday was just a glimpse at the future: fans filling seats, long lines at merchandise stands, a riveting competition taking place on stage. That commitment could only become more common in generations to come. “In the far away future — like 20 years from now — I don’t think there will be any non-gamers,” said Roberts. “I think kids today, they’ll have kids, and they’ll play games with their kids. It’s like who today do you know that doesn’t play any sports? Everyone at least has some familiarity. I think that’s where things are headed.” The Barclays crowd certainly knew what they were watching. They waved signs, cheered on their favorite players and were treated to an exciting finale. London entered the day having won three straight matches, including a 3-1 win on Friday. Led by 18-year old Joon-yeong Park, a damage specialist better known in the Overwatch world as “Profit,” the Spitfire won the Junkertown map, breezed through Lijiang Tower and then sealed the title by battling back and toppling the Fusion on King’s Row, a London-inspired map.

They had just smashed the New York Mets to pieces less than 12 hours earlier, a blowout featuring all sorts of franchise records, but another cloud, the latest in a 72-hour storm front, was hanging over the locker Shawn Kelley had occupied for nearly three full seasons. Kelley wasn’t there anymore. His nameplate was removed. His presence was erased and replaced by Jimmy Cordero because Kelley had spiked his glove and glared into the Nationals’ dugout out of frustration after allowing a home run in Tuesday’s rout. General Manager Mike Rizzo designated Kelley for assignment a couple hours later after trading Brandon Kintzler, whom the Nationals believed was a malcontent, earlier in the day. Rizzo acted swiftly and defiantly. Unlike Tuesday night’s shellacking, Wednesday’s 5-3 win over the Mets did not end on a sour note. It was as routine as a journeyman outdueling a bona fide ace can get. The Nationals pounced on Noah Syndergaard early, watched Tommy Milone sparkle over seven innings, and added insurance in their last at-bats to afford their new-look bullpen some breathing room. [Mike Rizzo delivers a message for Nationals: ‘If you’re not in, you’re in the way’] The Nationals (54-53) didn’t unload another batch of fireworks following Tuesday’s historic discharge, but they jumped out front on Syndergaard with Bryce Harper’s RBI single in the first. The hit, a groundball up the middle, hiked Harper’s batting average to .225. It was the highest it’s been since the middle of June. He finished 2 for 4, and with a .226 batting average. In the third inning, Anthony Rendon extended the lead to 3-0 with a two-run home run, his 16th this season. Meantime, Milone, a Mets castoff and journeyman, was silencing an anemic New York lineup. The left-hander compiled six strikeouts through three innings. He kept the Mets scoreless until the fifth, when Jose Reyes, who made his pitching debut the previous night, socked a solo home run. The homer was Reyes’s first since April 29 and second this season, matching the home run total he allowed on the mound Tuesday. After pitching to an 8.56 ERA in 11 appearances with the Mets last season, Milone limited his former team to the one run across seven innings. He compiled nine strikeouts, his most since 2013 and one short of his career high. Milone’s outing extended the Nationals rotation’s recent success: Over the past week, Washington’s starters have posted the best ERA in the National League. It’s a tiny sample size, but encouraging. The Nationals are a dangerous team when their starting rotation is good. They’re bad when it’s not. This season is evidence. Milone’s standout performance was necessary because Syndergaard settled in. Making his first start since going on the disabled list because of hand, foot, and mouth disease, Syndergaard retired 12 straight batters after Rendon’s home run. He then surrendered a leadoff single to Daniel Murphy in the seventh inning, but escaped unscathed. Syndergaard’s effort kept it a two-run game, a lead that Reyes halved with a solo home run off Ryan Madson for his 11th career multi-homer game. Suddenly, the Nationals were in a high-pressure spot for the first time without Sean Doolittle and Kintzler. Madson did not yield another run, though, and Washington tacked on a couple more runs to pad the cushion for Kelvin Herrera, the closer until Doolittle returns, in the ninth inning. The Nationals needed the extra leeway because Herrera allowed a flyball to the warning that a leaping Juan Soto knocked over the wall for a solo home run. Herrera then surrendered a double to Michael Conforto and walked Jose Bautista before getting Brandon Nimmo to ground into a game-ending double play. It wasn’t easy, but Herrera’s glove stayed on his hand and the Nationals won again.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Kareem Copeland August 1 at 3:07 PM Email the author   Speed was the most commonly used word in Paul Richardson’s scouting report when the Washington Redskins signed him in free agency this offseason, but that wasn’t all that was on display Wednesday. The new $40 million man showed off his hands and some toughness on what may have been his best practice of training camp. He had a reception of about 30 yards when he ran past Josh Norman and outstretched parallel to the ground to haul in an Alex Smith pass. The 6-foot, 170-pounder got behind another pair of defensive backs earlier, but Smith overthrew him. He added another touchdown in a short-yardage period where he put a nasty outside-in move on cornerback Quinton Dunbar after bouncing back from getting the wind knocked out of him a couple of plays earlier. Richardson had another diving catch for about 20 yards during the workout. “I’m comfortable every day,” Richardson said. “I’ve been comfortable since I got here. We’re just connecting, making plays. I see the ball and try to go get it. “We’re just throwing it more. We see a lot of things on film we want to get to. I think today was a day we really wanted to make a point to get to those things. Alex made it a priority to throw some of those corner routes, throw some of those deep balls, and we connected.” [Josh Doctson injures his shoulder during Redskins practice] Many observers continue to be skeptical about Smith’s ability to throw the deep ball, but that hasn’t been an issue during camp. The top three receivers of Richardson, Jamison Crowder, and Josh Doctson (who went down with a shoulder injury during practice, but later tweeted “#imgood”) have all had strong camps, but there’s a bit of a gap between them and the rest of the rotation. Maurice Harris, Brian Quick, Robert Davis and Trey Quinn have all had their moments, but the team kept just six receivers last season. Some won’t make the 53-man roster, and special teams ability will play a role in that decision. “Very important, if one guy can stand out on special teams, then that’s your fourth — period,” Coach Jay Gruden said. “You know, we understand that we have to improve on special teams instead of just saying that on the podium or in meeting rooms, we’re going to have to commit to it by maybe keeping somebody that is better on special teams, but maybe not quite as polished at receiver. “A lot of teams do that, but usually your fourth guy is going to be more of a true wide receiver. Your fifth guy could more in that role. So, we’ll have to wait and see even as a backup returner, a flier or whatever it might be.” [Former Redskins safety DeAngelo Hall swears — literally — that he is now retired] Play of the day Richardson had a couple plays that could have fit here, but there was a Jordan Reed reception that fans loved for a couple of reasons. Reed had a five-yard diving touchdown catch in the back of the end zone from Smith on a third-and-goal situation, in a preview of a connection that could be fruitful during the season. Reed seemed to get more physical work Wednesday than before, going through an individual blocking drill early in practice. The diving touchdown showed some trust in those two toes that underwent surgery, and was a reminder of how valuable of a target he can be at 6-2, 245 pounds with soft hands. Anderson running wild Second-year linebacker Ryan Anderson surprised many when he ended up in coverage against speedy running back Chris Thompson. The diminutive third-down back came out of the backfield and turned up the sideline with Anderson trailing. But Thompson didn’t pull away and the 6-5, 265-pound Anderson ran with him stride for stride. Anderson has been dealing with back spasms in training camp, but is expected to see an increased role in 2018. “As a rookie, I think a lot of the guys have high expectations,” Gruden said of the 2017 second-round pick, “of their coming in and leading the league in sacks and tackles and forced fumbles and passes batted down and all that stuff. But in reality, you’ve got to earn your stripes, especially if you’re playing behind somebody of great quality like Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith. “So, he’ll get his work and we’ll continue to work him. The big thing for him is to put practices back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back together [and] continue to get better. But I see steady improvement and growth from him in the weight room, his weight, his effort, so I like where Ryan’s at.” Roster moves The Redskins signed free agent linebacker Dadi Nicolas. To make room on the roster, they waived offensive linemen Alex Balducci. Nicolas was drafted in the sixth round of the 2016 draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. The 6-3, 239-pounder played 11 games as a rookie, but ruptured his patellar tendon in the playoffs and did not play in 2017.

(Gus Ruelas/Associated Press)   by Cindy Boren August 1 at 1:39 PM Email the author   Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott has gotten an earful since he told reporters last week that he doesn’t think a football game “is the time or the venue” for demonstrations and protests during the national anthem, a stance that was more closely aligned with owner Jerry Jones than with many of his co-workers. Prescott is trying his best to set the record straight, saying this week that he wasn’t oblivious to the criticism, and trying to explain what sets him apart from Jones, whose my-way-or-the-highway position reportedly led the NFL to stifle him as it tries to work out a viable anthem policy with the NFL Players Association. “You get on social media you see it. It doesn’t bother me,” Prescott told Clarence E. Hill Jr. of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “I said what I said. You have an opinion. Everyone else has an opinion. They are entitled to it as well. I accepted what they said and respect it. They should respect mine.” Prescott’s opinion from last week? “I never protest during the anthem, and I don’t think that’s the time or the venue to do so,” he said. “The game of football has always brought me such peace, and I think it does the same for a lot of people — a lot of people playing the game, a lot of people watching the game, a lot of people who have any impact of the game — so when you bring such controversy to the stadium, to the field, to the game, it takes away. It takes away from that, it takes away from the joy and the love that football brings a lot of people. “For me, I’m all about making a change and making a difference, and I think this whole kneeling and all of that was just about raising awareness and the fact that we’re still talking about social injustice years later, I think we’ve gotten to that point. I think we’ve proved, we know the social injustice. I’m up for taking the next step whatever the next step may be for action and not just kneeling. I’ve always believed standing up for what I believe in, and that’s what I’m going to continue to do.” Not everyone heard all of that, though. [Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen rips Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for his anthem stance and for not following it himself] The Raiders’ Tahir Whitehead tweeted that “it looks like Dak don’t [sic] want to lose that Campbell’s Chunky Soup deal!” The Undefeated defended him by using the headline: “Dak Prescott isn’t a race traitor because he thinks there’s a better way to protest.” Prescott became the subject of endless debate on sports networks and radio stations. And Twitter was on fire over the matter. “I think there was a little misunderstanding of the fact of what I believe in,” Prescott told Hill. “I never said I didn’t believe in social injustice and things that were going on. I just said I didn’t think that the national anthem was the time. It’s two minutes out of our day that we could also be spending embracing what our country should be and what our country is going to be one day that we know that it’s not right now. That is the sad part about it — that it’s not. “I respect everybody. And power to the people that kneel. That is what they believe in and they should be able to kneel. For me, the game of football has been such a peace. It’s a moment for me to be at peace and think about all the great things our country does have even though we know it’s not a good for us right now.” As he said, he prefers community involvement to symbolism. “I am for the action,” Prescott said. “I am for joining [the Philadelphia Eagles’] Malcolm [Jenkins] and joining those guys in doing something different. That is what I mean my taking that next step rather than just kneeling or standing. I don’t think kneeling or standing is creating a solution for us.” Jones helped resurrect the national anthem debate last week, saying that “our policy [for players] is you stand for the anthem, toe on the line.”\\xa0Stephen Jones, the Cowboys’ executive vice president, took his father’s position to another level, saying players should stand on the sideline “if they want to be a Dallas Cowboy.”\\xa0Although Jerry Jones later added that Trump’s “interest in what we’re doing is problematic,” the president\\xa0offered his support\\xa0for Jones, one of the NFL owners taking a hard line on the issue, in a tweet: “Way to go Jerry.

The Nationals’ first baseman grinned as he returned to the dugout. Reyes smiled, too, for his ERA was a sparkling 0.00. That wouldn’t last. The Nationals tagged Reyes for six runs on five hits in the inning and batted around, giving Zimmerman another chance with two outs and Wilmer Difo on third base following an RBI triple.    (Via MLB.tv)  As Reyes’s teammates giggled from the top step of the dugout, Zimmerman swung through a couple of curveballs in his second plate appearance against the veteran shortstop. After Zimmerman fouled off another slow offering, Reyes “plunked” Zimmerman’s left leg with a 54 mph curveball that didn’t curve and probably didn’t leave a mark.

Swimming at the\\xa0Far Western Long Course Championships in Moraga, Calif., Apuada finished the 100-meter butterfly in 1:09.38, besting Phelps’s 23-year-old, 10-and-under meet record of\\xa01:10.48 by more than a second. “That was one of my dreams — to beat Michael Phelps’s record — since I was 7,” Apuado said in the above video. In 1996, Phelps set the overall U.S. 10-and-under record for the 100 butterfly at\\xa01:08.54, a mark that since has been bested by Carson Foster in 2012 (1:07.24) and then Andrew Rogers, who broke the record twice at a 2015 meet in Texas. Rogers’s 1:05.98 still stands as the 10-and-under U.S. record in the 100 butterfly. Apuada, a rising fifth-grader who has been swimming competitively for four years, ended up with gold medals in every event he swam in at the meet, winning the 200 individual medley, 50 butterfly, 50 backstroke, 100 backstroke, 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle to go along with his 100 butterfly crown. As for his nickname, Apuada’s mother Cynthia told the Huffington Post that she always liked the name Clark and that her husband’s favorite superhero was Superman, and everything just flowed naturally from there. “We’re always just telling people his name is Clark. But when they realize his full name, people just call him Superman,” Cynthia Apuada said. Not to get too far into the (nerdy) weeds here, but Arthur Curry Apuada perhaps would have been a more apt name.

(Tony Avelar/AP)   by Cindy Boren August 1 at 10:45 AM Email the author   The tennis match was over almost before it had begun, and this time, Serena Williams was on the receiving end of the domination, experiencing the most lopsided loss of her career. For the first time, Williams managed to win only one game in a professional match, holding serve in the first set and then being bulldozed by Johanna Konta, 6-1, 6-0, on Tuesday night in the first round of the Silicon Valley Classic in San Jose. Williams’s loss eclipsed a 6-0, 6-2 drubbing she suffered at the hands of Simona Halep in the 2014 WTA finals in Singapore. Konta is 48th in the world, according to the WTA rankings. “I know I can play a zillion times better, so that kind of helps out, too. I have so many things on my mind I don’t have time to be shocked about a loss that clearly wasn’t at my best right now,” Williams said, via the Associated Press. “When I was out there, [I] was fighting. That’s the only thing I can say. I wasn’t just like giving it away, and I was moving a lot better. So I’m just trying to take the positives out of it.” Despite a run to the final at Wimbledon, Williams — 26th in the WTA rankings — has struggled at times during her return to competitive tennis to reach her typical level of play. She gave birth to her first child by Caesarean section last September and subsequently dealt with a litany of health issues, including\\xa0a pulmonary embolism. “It’s difficult, I guess,” she said Tuesday, speaking of her inability to regain her consistency and dominance. She then amended that comment: “Not, ‘I guess.’ For sure.” Despite her 6-3, 6-3 loss to Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon final, Williams appeared to gain some confidence in her game during that tournament, saying before the final,\\xa0“This is not inevitable for me” after a 13-month absence from the tour. Williams, who has worn compression shorts under her dress because of her history of blood clots, tearfully said after that loss that her mind-set had changed and that she was now playing for “all the moms out there.” What will the U.S. Open, the last Grand Slam event of the year, bring? “I didn’t know a couple of months ago where I was, where I would be, how I would do, how I would be able to come back,” she said after the Wimbledon loss, which came a little over a month after she withdrew from the French Open with a pectoral injury. “It was such a long way to see light at the end of the road, kind of.

Asked to pitch the ninth inning with the Nats leading 25-1, the veteran allowed three runs on four hits, one of which was a two-run homer by Austin Jackson. After that pitch, Kelley slammed his glove to the ground and glared into the dugout. Even amateur interpreters might surmise that Kelley was not pleased to be pitching in that situation at all. “No, you can ask everybody in the bullpen. When [Wander] Suero’s pitch count got up, I said, ‘I’ve probably got the ninth.’ I figured I was the freshest reliever and I was going to throw the ninth,” Kelley said Tuesday night, adding that his frustration was due to disagreements with the umpires who were prodding him on his pace. “Like I said, for me, I’m not justifying it. I should not have thrown my glove and acted like a baby out there. But at the same time, I’m acting like it’s one to one for me. I’m giving it everything I’ve got.” [After a stress-packed deadline day, Nats hammer Mets in a laugher] Kelley recorded the final three outs, nonetheless, and the Nationals won, 25-4. Earlier in the day, the Nationals traded Brandon Kintzler to the Cubs. Mike Rizzo and Dave Martinez said one reason they felt they could make the deal was the emergence of Suero, who can pitch multiple innings and has proved himself resilient when handed heavy workloads. But when Suero’s pitch count climbed to 29, Martinez called on Kelley for the ninth inning. Just before the home run he allowed to Jackson, Kelley got into a heated conversation with second base umpire Tripp Gibson III. He had also had a back and forth with home plate umpire Adrian Johnson. He said he felt like calls pitchers were getting earlier in the game were not going his way. “[Johnson] told me to slow down. I was a) just trying to keep it going, and b) I’ve used the quick pitch sometimes. He told me to slow down one time, and the other guy behind me [at second base] told me I had to come set or it’s a balk,” Kelley said. “… Then the home plate umpire was telling me to hurry up. I was like, ‘But you told me to slow down.’ It was kind of frustrating. That’s all that was about.” [Svrluga: Nats hang on to Bryce Harper at deadline as Mike Rizzo bets on horses he rode in on] That glare into the dugout, however, casts unavoidable doubt about the true source of that frustration. Kelley’s teammates seemed to think so, too. After the game, Ryan Madson and Max Scherzer approached Kelley for a hushed conversation that did not get heated and ended with pats on the back. But conversations like those do not generally happen after a player shows frustration in a normal bad outing. Martinez said Tuesday that he thought Kelley was just frustrated with the umpires. “I think the homer, and the whole thing with trying to pitch fast and the umpire telling him to stop,” Martinez said. “He was arguing. I gather that’s what it was.” But whatever the reality of the situation, the incident raised questions on a day that initially looked like it would bolster the notion of team solidarity, not undermine it.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)   by Scott Allen August 1 at 10:25 AM Email the author   Things got weird on the Mets’ TV broadcast during the eighth inning of the Nationals’ record-setting, 25-4 victory Tuesday night — and that was before New York shortstop Jose Reyes made his pitching debut in the bottom of the frame. “With the score and the weather and everything being as it is, we are going to unveil another edition of what we like to call Media Guide Musings,” SNY analyst Gary Cohen said as Kevin Plawecki stepped in against Nationals pitcher Wander Suero with the rain falling and Washington leading 19-1 to start the inning. “This is going to be a collaborative effort. We’re going to start on page 420 of the Mets’ media guide, the postseason section. The first page of the postseason section is the 1969 League Championship Series, Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets.” For the next six minutes, Cohen and his broadcast partners, Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez, stopped calling the ugly action on the field and read directly from the media guide. It was a history lesson from happier times for the Mets, and it was brilliant.    (Via MLB.tv)  “In the club’s first-ever trip to the postseason, the Mets swept the best-of-five series versus Atlanta, three games to none,” Cohen began as the theme from “Masterpiece Theatre” played in the background. “In Game 1, trailing 5-4 in the top of the eighth, New York rallied for five runs and a 9-5 win. Tom Seaver struggled, allowed five runs in seven innings, but earned the victory. In Game 2, two-run home runs by Tommie Agee, Ken Boswell and Cleon Jones lifted the Mets to an 11-6 win. In front of 54,195 fans at Shea — I might add, parenthetically, I was one of them — New York advanced to the World Series with a 7-4 victory in Game 3. The lead changed hands three times before Wayne Garrett’s two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth put the Mets ahead 5-4. Nolan Ryan hurled seven innings in relief to pick up the win and complete the sweep. Boswell hit .333 with two home runs and five RBI, while Agee batted .357 with two home runs and four RBI. Hank Aaron cracked a home run in each game and drove in seven runs for the Braves. We’re going to move to page 422.” “Is it my turn to read?” Darling asked as the music continued to play and the booth continued to ignore whatever was happening on the field. “Page 422, if you have it at home, folks. This is the 1969 World Series, the Baltimore Orioles versus the Mets. The Mets, of course, won the series, 4-1. The New York Mets entered the 1969 World Series as heavy underdogs against Baltimore. After failing in Game 1, The Amazins rattled off four straight wins to earn their first championship just eight years after the franchise was born.” “It’s like a Seder,” Cohen said before Darling eventually passed the book to Hernandez. “A raucous Shea crowd of 56,335 watched the Mets shut out Baltimore, 5-0, in Game 3,” Hernandez said. “Tommie Agee hit a leadoff home run off Jim Palmer, the only leadoff home run the Hall of Famer would ever allow, to put the Mets on the board early.” [After a stress-packed deadline day, Nats hammer Mets in a laugher] Cohen wrapped up the impromptu story time by reading the guide’s account of the Mets’ World Series-clinching win on Oct. 16, 1969. By this point, there was one out in the inning and a runner on first. “Behind a 5-3 victory, New York’s lovable losers were champions,” he said. “The Orioles led 3-0 early, but home runs by [Donn] Clendenon and [Al] Weis tied the game. In the eighth, [Ron] Swoboda gave the Mets the lead with an RBI double. [Jerry] Koosman induced future Mets manager Davey Johnson to fly out to Cleon Jones in left field for the final out. Jones (Sport Magazine) and Weis (Baseball Writers of America) were the series MVPs. And so concludes page 422, the 1969 World Series.”  \\ufeff  Cohen and Co. previously passed the time during the late innings of yet another Mets loss by reading from the media guide\\xa0on July 10. Here are a few numbers from Tuesday’s game that would make good fodder for a future “Media Guide Musings” segment, perhaps as early as Wednesday’s matinee at Nationals Park. 7: Runs in the first inning for the Nationals, the most in the first inning by a National League team this season.

Happ, acquired by the New York Yankees in a trade late last week, has been diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, becoming the second Major League Baseball pitcher afflicted over the last two weeks. Happ was diagnosed with what the team said is a mild case; it is unclear how he came down with a viral disease most common among children under the age of 5. One possibility is that he was infected on a commercial cross-country flight after being traded Thursday by the Toronto Blue Jays. “I got a call from our trainer,” General Manager Brian Cashman told reporters. “He said, ‘I’m not sure what’s going on here, but J.A. Happ has some complaints. He’s not feeling right, and he had noticed some blistering.’ ” Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard was the first player afflicted this summer. He was placed on the 10-day disabled list with the illness, which is highly contagious, on July 22 after a start at Yankee Stadium. The Mets believe Syndergaard came down with the disease when he visited a kids’ camp over the all-star break. Syndergaard is expected to be activated Wednesday. The Yankees do not, for now, plan to place Happ on the disabled list. Happ is 11-6 after winning his Yankees debut Sunday, and Cashman said he “probably” would be able to start against the Red Sox in the four-game series that begins Thursday at Fenway Park. He is scheduled to pitch Saturday. “I can only convey to you what our internist who evaluated Happ conveyed to me,” Cashman said. “He feels currently this is a mild case, but he’ll stay connected.\\xa0We’ll be in a better position [Wednesday] to evaluate whether this is toward the tail end of this thing or if it’s ramping up.” For Syndergaard, one clue that he was ill came during a start in which the velocity of his pitches was low and he was having trouble breathing. Happ complained of blisters on his hands when he arrived at Yankee Stadium and was sent to New York Presbyterian Hospital.\\xa0Symptoms,\\xa0according to the Mayo Clinic, can include fever; sore throat; malaise; painful, blister-like lesions; and a red rash. Although people afflicted with the virus are most contagious during the first week, it can remain in the body for weeks after symptoms and signs are gone. Some people — especially adults — can pass the virus (often by coughing or sneezing) without showing any symptoms of the ailment. “There’s no real treatment. You just monitor the patient and let the virus take its course,” Cashman said. “He’s still scheduled to start. That’s not something that as of now is in jeopardy as of yet. . . .

In May, reliever Sergio Romo became the first pitcher since the Oakland Athletics’ Steve McCatty in 1980 to start on consecutive days after pitching at least one inning the first day (Romo had made zero starts in 588 career appearances before that two-game stretch). But Faria and then Snell were sent to the disabled list and then Archer was dealt to the Pirates, leaving Tampa Bay with zero starters, at least temporarily.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)   by Scott Allen August 1 at 10:25 AM Email the author   Things got weird on the Mets’ TV broadcast during the eighth inning of the Nationals’ record-setting, 25-4 victory Tuesday night — and that was before New York shortstop Jose Reyes made his pitching debut in the bottom of the frame. “With the score and the weather and everything being as it is, we are going to unveil another edition of what we like to call Media Guide Musings,” SNY analyst Gary Cohen said as Kevin Plawecki stepped in against Nationals pitcher Wander Suero with the rain falling and Washington leading 19-1 to start the inning. “This is going to be a collaborative effort. We’re going to start on page 420 of the Mets’ media guide, the postseason section. The first page of the postseason section is the 1969 League Championship Series, Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets.” For the next six minutes, Cohen and his broadcast partners, Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez, stopped calling the ugly action on the field and read directly from the media guide. It was a history lesson from happier times for the Mets, and it was brilliant.    (Via MLB.tv)  “In the club’s first-ever trip to the postseason, the Mets swept the best-of-five series versus Atlanta, three games to none,” Cohen began as the theme from “Masterpiece Theatre” played in the background. “In Game 1, trailing 5-4 in the top of the eighth, New York rallied for five runs and a 9-5 win. Tom Seaver struggled, allowed five runs in seven innings, but earned the victory. In Game 2, two-run home runs by Tommie Agee, Ken Boswell and Cleon Jones lifted the Mets to an 11-6 win. In front of 54,195 fans at Shea — I might add, parenthetically, I was one of them — New York advanced to the World Series with a 7-4 victory in Game 3. The lead changed hands three times before Wayne Garrett’s two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth put the Mets ahead 5-4. Nolan Ryan hurled seven innings in relief to pick up the win and complete the sweep. Boswell hit .333 with two home runs and five RBI, while Agee batted .357 with two home runs and four RBI. Hank Aaron cracked a home run in each game and drove in seven runs for the Braves. We’re going to move to page 422.” “Is it my turn to read?” Darling asked as the music continued to play and the booth continued to ignore whatever was happening on the field. “Page 422, if you have it at home, folks. This is the 1969 World Series, the Baltimore Orioles versus the Mets. The Mets, of course, won the series, 4-1. The New York Mets entered the 1969 World Series as heavy underdogs against Baltimore. After failing in Game 1, The Amazins rattled off four straight wins to earn their first championship just eight years after the franchise was born.” “It’s like a Seder,” Cohen said before Darling eventually passed the book to Hernandez. “A raucous Shea crowd of 56,335 watched the Mets shut out Baltimore, 5-0, in Game 3,” Hernandez said. “Tommie Agee hit a leadoff home run off Jim Palmer, the only leadoff home run the Hall of Famer would ever allow, to put the Mets on the board early.” [After a stress-packed deadline day, Nats hammer Mets in a laugher] Cohen wrapped up the impromptu story time by reading the guide’s account of the Mets’ World Series-clinching win on Oct. 16, 1969. By this point, there was one out in the inning and a runner on first. “Behind a 5-3 victory, New York’s lovable losers were champions,” he said. “The Orioles led 3-0 early, but home runs by [Donn] Clendenon and [Al] Weis tied the game. In the eighth, [Ron] Swoboda gave the Mets the lead with an RBI double. [Jerry] Koosman induced future Mets manager Davey Johnson to fly out to Cleon Jones in left field for the final out. Jones (Sport Magazine) and Weis (Baseball Writers of America) were the series MVPs. And so concludes page 422, the 1969 World Series.”  \\ufeff  Cohen and Co. previously passed the time during the late innings of yet another Mets loss by reading from the media guide\\xa0on July 10. Here are a few numbers from Tuesday’s game that would make good fodder for a future “Media Guide Musings” segment, perhaps as early as Wednesday’s matinee at Nationals Park. 7: Runs in the first inning for the Nationals, the most in the first inning by a National League team this season.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)   by Chelsea Janes August 1 at 12:30 PM Email the author   The message is clear now, delivered first by the trade of Brandon Kintzler, then emphatically when the Washington Nationals designated Shawn Kelley for assignment early Wednesday morning. “If you’re not in, you’re in the way,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said hours later, acknowledging that the reason he sent both men packing was his feeling that they were undermining clubhouse culture. Kelley threw his glove and glared into the dugout after allowing a home run to Austin Jackson in what had been a 25-1 game. Kelley said afterward that he was frustrated with umpires missing calls and prodding him on his pace. Manager Dave Martinez, protecting his player, said he believed that’s all it was. Rizzo said he saw what many who noticed Kelley’s glare inferred. Kelley was frustrated to be pitching in a game such as that one in the first place and showed up his manager. His agent, Mike McCann, later told ESPN Kelley was hoping Martinez would argue on his behalf. Rizzo thought differently. “I [interpreted as Kelley frustrated to be in the game]. It may not have been, but that’s the way I looked at it,” Rizzo said. ” .\\u2009.\\u2009. After what happened before the game yesterday, getting ready for post-deadline season, I thought it was truly a day we should have been happy and celebrating — we had a big win against a division rival and felt good about ourselves — and such a selfish act is not what we’re here for.” [‘Is it my turn to read?’: Mets’ TV broadcast got weird during 25-4 loss to Nats] The Nationals signed Kelley to a three-year, $15 million dollar deal before the 2016 season. In his 2 1/2 years with them, he grew into a beloved clubhouse presence, a jovial guy who made newcomers feel comfortable. After his outburst Tuesday night, Max Scherzer and Ryan Madson spoke with Kelley in hushed tones, the kind of conversation they do not usually have with veteran teammates after bad performances. Obviously, they noticed his reaction. Everyone did, and Rizzo believed he had to move. “It’s pretty cut and dry. You guys all saw it. The act that he portrayed on the field last night was disrespectful to the name on the front of the jersey, the organization, specifically Davey Martinez,” Rizzo said. “And you’re either in or you’re in the way. And I thought he was in the way.” [Svrluga: Nats hang on to Bryce Harper at deadline as Mike Rizzo bets on horses he rode in on] Kelley had bounced back from a brutal 2017 season and was pitching to a 3.34 ERA in 35 appearances. A person familiar with the Nationals’ plans said they listened to offers for the free agent-to-be before Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline and they could still get something for him now that he has been designated for assignment. He is the second well-liked veteran to go in the last 24 hours, as Rizzo dealt Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs just before the deadline. People familiar with the situation said Rizzo confronted Kintzler about being the anonymous source for various reports that painted an unflattering picture of the Nationals’ clubhouse culture. Kintzler denied being that source in an interview on 106.7 the Fan on Wednesday. “I’ve never talked to that [author] Jeff Passan guy in my life, so that’s an interesting accusation,” Kintzler said on the show “Grant & Danny.” “I know for a fact that someone got him to admit his source was not a player, so it wasn’t me. I’ve never talked to that guy in my life.” Rizzo didn’t explicitly acknowledge that clubhouse culture was the reasoning behind the Kintzler deal but did not reject the premise when asked whether his decisions on Kintzler and Kelley represented a shift in mentality about players who undermine their manager. “We’ve always had that stance. We’ve always had a stance that if you’re not with us, you’re against us, and you’re in the way,” Rizzo said. “The culture here has been so good for so long. We’ve had so much success over the last seven years that we’re not going to let anybody interfere with that success. . . . We’re not going to let any one person derail what we’re going to do.” Martinez seemed to struggle to with the move, eyes welling for the second time in two days when he spoke about having to designate Kelley, whom he said he “respected” and “is not a bad person.” The Nationals will have to absorb the remaining portion of Kelley’s salary, unless another team picks him up on waivers, which seems unlikely. That, in itself, should demonstrate the frustration the front office felt at his outburst and the optics it created for a team already answering questions about its clubhouse culture. Without him, the Nationals have lost two of their most outspoken veterans in the bullpen, leaving Madson, injured Sean Doolittle and newcomer Kelvin Herrera as the longest-tenured members of that corps. “Those are two guys within our bullpen, two of our more vocal guys. They were vocal leaders, and they led that way,” Doolittle said. “Now it’s going to fall on somebody to kind of step up and assume that role.” The Nationals recalled right-hander Jimmy Cordero to replace Kelley on the roster. The 26-year-old is pitching to a 1.88 ERA in 38 games for Syracuse this season and has struck out more than a batter per inning. In Cordero and Wander Suero, the Nationals get two durable, versatile relievers who can provide them multiple innings. Kintzler and Kelley, as more veteran players with injury histories, limited Martinez’s options more. But jettisoning Kelley was not about on-field performance. Rizzo left no doubt about that.

(Gus Ruelas/Associated Press)   by Cindy Boren August 1 at 1:39 PM Email the author   Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott has gotten an earful since he told reporters last week that he doesn’t think a football game “is the time or the venue” for demonstrations and protests during the national anthem, a stance that was more closely aligned with owner Jerry Jones than with many of his co-workers. Prescott is trying his best to set the record straight, saying this week that he wasn’t oblivious to the criticism, and trying to explain what sets him apart from Jones, whose my-way-or-the-highway position reportedly led the NFL to stifle him as it tries to work out a viable anthem policy with the NFL Players Association. “You get on social media you see it. It doesn’t bother me,” Prescott told Clarence E. Hill Jr. of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “I said what I said. You have an opinion. Everyone else has an opinion. They are entitled to it as well. I accepted what they said and respect it. They should respect mine.” Prescott’s opinion from last week? “I never protest during the anthem, and I don’t think that’s the time or the venue to do so,” he said. “The game of football has always brought me such peace, and I think it does the same for a lot of people — a lot of people playing the game, a lot of people watching the game, a lot of people who have any impact of the game — so when you bring such controversy to the stadium, to the field, to the game, it takes away. It takes away from that, it takes away from the joy and the love that football brings a lot of people. “For me, I’m all about making a change and making a difference, and I think this whole kneeling and all of that was just about raising awareness and the fact that we’re still talking about social injustice years later, I think we’ve gotten to that point. I think we’ve proved, we know the social injustice. I’m up for taking the next step whatever the next step may be for action and not just kneeling. I’ve always believed standing up for what I believe in, and that’s what I’m going to continue to do.” Not everyone heard all of that, though. [Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen rips Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for his anthem stance and for not following it himself] The Raiders’ Tahir Whitehead tweeted that “it looks like Dak don’t [sic] want to lose that Campbell’s Chunky Soup deal!” The Undefeated defended him by using the headline: “Dak Prescott isn’t a race traitor because he thinks there’s a better way to protest.” Prescott became the subject of endless debate on sports networks and radio stations. And Twitter was on fire over the matter. “I think there was a little misunderstanding of the fact of what I believe in,” Prescott told Hill. “I never said I didn’t believe in social injustice and things that were going on. I just said I didn’t think that the national anthem was the time. It’s two minutes out of our day that we could also be spending embracing what our country should be and what our country is going to be one day that we know that it’s not right now. That is the sad part about it — that it’s not. “I respect everybody. And power to the people that kneel. That is what they believe in and they should be able to kneel. For me, the game of football has been such a peace. It’s a moment for me to be at peace and think about all the great things our country does have even though we know it’s not a good for us right now.” As he said, he prefers community involvement to symbolism. “I am for the action,” Prescott said. “I am for joining [the Philadelphia Eagles’] Malcolm [Jenkins] and joining those guys in doing something different. That is what I mean my taking that next step rather than just kneeling or standing. I don’t think kneeling or standing is creating a solution for us.” Jones helped resurrect the national anthem debate last week, saying that “our policy [for players] is you stand for the anthem, toe on the line.”\\xa0Stephen Jones, the Cowboys’ executive vice president, took his father’s position to another level, saying players should stand on the sideline “if they want to be a Dallas Cowboy.”\\xa0Although Jerry Jones later added that Trump’s “interest in what we’re doing is problematic,” the president\\xa0offered his support\\xa0for Jones, one of the NFL owners taking a hard line on the issue, in a tweet: “Way to go Jerry.

(Patrick Semansky/AP)   by Sam Fortier August 1 at 12:07 PM Email the author   OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Robert Griffin III stepped to the microphone and grinned at the reporters as if he’d missed this. It was late morning at Under Armour Performance Center and the Baltimore Ravens, his third team in four years, had just finished practice. As Griffin started to respond to a reporter who greeted him, he realized how close the mic was to his mouth. “This is awkward,” he said, flashing his familiar, gaptoothed smile. The grin had been seen rarely since Griffin, for whom the Washington Redskins traded a bounty of draft picks to select second overall in 2012, the year after he won the Heisman Trophy at Baylor, carried Washington to its first playoff appearance in five seasons as a rookie. That year, Griffin’s jersey sold more than any other in the league, and a brand was born: “RG3.” Just a few years later, Griffin had all but vanished from the realm of NFL relevancy. Injuries and a building tension between Griffin and Washington set up an ugly end, and after an injury-shortened season in Cleveland, he was out of the league. At the mic, Griffin tried to distance himself from what happened down the Beltway while facing questions about how he would dig himself out of the rubble of once-great expectations. Ravens Coach John Harbaugh told reporters Griffin’s absence from the game for a year didn’t worry him, that it “wasn’t a very hard” call to sign him and General Manager Ozzie Newsome had decided “pretty quickly.” Griffin, 28, answered with a similar earnestness. He compared being away from football to “someone taking your girl, it gives you an appreciation,” joked about staying in shape by throwing footballs at palm trees, and asserted he was faster than rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson, another speedy Heisman winner who was drafted No. 32 overall in April as the heir apparent to starting quarterback Joe Flacco. In discussing that year away, Griffin never mentioned how much he prepared for life after football — or how the 2020 Olympic Games had come to mind. Griffin understands it will take more than his natural talent for him to make the team. The Ravens have not carried three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster since 2009. He will have his first chance to show everyone what can still do on Thursday, as Baltimore faces Chicago in the Hall of Fame Game at 8 p.m. “Everyone laughs about the sayings I had when I first came into the league, but ‘No pressure, no diamonds’ is one that stuck with me,” Griffin told The Washington Post. “That’s what we said in college. I’ve been under a lot of pressure in my life. I’ve been under a lot of pressure in my NFL career. I’m ready to shine. I think God’s prepared me for it.”    Griffin is likely third on the team’s QB depth chart behind starter Joe Flacco (right) and rookie first-round pick Lamar Jackson (not pictured). (Patrick Semansky/AP)  To listen to Griffin tell it, leaving football “never crossed my mind.” Those around him got a different impression. In the summer of 2017, he was living in Orlando with his second wife, Estonian heptathlete Grete Sadeiko. He received contract offers from Arizona and Baltimore, but neither situation seemed right because of personnel or timing, so he turned them down. Still, though, he trained. “Anyone going through something hard has doubts,” Griffin said, quickly clarifying that he never doubted himself throughout this process. He meant those around him. “My wife would say, ‘Why are you doing this? Why are you running these hills? Why are you throwing these footballs, studying this film? You’re not getting that call. Why keep doing that?’” Last winter, Griffin cold-called a training facility he’d heard of near home and, within a week, he walked into the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. The facility appealed to Griffin because it had football and a track-and-field program, helmed by famous coach Brooks Johnson, who also trained Sadeiko. At Baylor, Griffin ran the 400-meter hurdles all the way to the 2008 Olympic Trials semifinals but left track — even though “at heart, I’m a track guy” — to focus on football. He started to consider a comeback. Griffin split time between the football and track workouts, where he trained alongside Olympians, including Justin Gatlin, the reigning world-champion sprinter who last year outran Usain Bolt for the gold in the 100-meter dash. Griffin, who once weighed more than 225 pounds, had slimmed down to 193. He spoke with Johnson about preparing for the decathlon or the 110-meter hurdles. “He didn’t look at himself as RG3,” Gatlin said. “He looked at himself as Robert. He was hungry, and he had another a shot to get back out there.”     Robert Griffin III took the NFL by storm during his rookie season with the Redskins in 2012. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)     American sprinter Justin Gatlin said that within a year, Griffin would have been seriously contending for a spot in the Olympics. (Jae C. Hong/AP)    For about 10 weeks, Griffin arrived at the facility four days per week at 8:30 a.m. and, over the next five hours, stretched, lifted weights, honed footwork and threw to receivers. Whenever workouts called for speed, he sidled over to Johnson. When asked if track was a plan B, Griffin said he didn’t think so, citing one of his favorite quotes from actor Will Smith: “There’s no reason to have a plan B because it distracts from plan A.” But the track group watched Griffin chip away at his rusty technique. At first, his body launched wide and splayed over the hurdles, but it quickly became tighter. Griffin is 6-foot-2, but Gatlin said football’s emphasis on low centers of gravity conditioned Griffin to run as if he were 5-foot-2. His short strides generated less power. Slowly, Griffin ran straighter, lengthening his legs. The knee injury that hampered his football career seemed to have no effect. Within a year, Gatlin and Johnson said, Griffin would have seriously contended for a spot at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. “He is an Olympic-level talent,” Johnson said. “It didn’t take a lot to get him technically sound.” Then Baltimore called. It was late March, at the beginning of free agency, and Griffin considered it “a message from God” and that “things don’t just happen by accident.” He inked a one-year, $1.1 million deal. In the facility, during stretches and cool-downs, Griffin started bringing index cards made from the Ravens playbook. While they worked out together, Sadeiko quizzed him on the team’s formations and he listed off the personnel. Some people around Griffin attribute his shelving of track, again, to the money at stake in the NFL. For others, it’s deeper. Griffin’s life has seemingly been governed by the same purpose since his uncle signed him up for youth football two decades ago. He was recently told by two global track powers that he’s still got it, and he still returned to the sport where he’s torn his right anterior cruciate ligament twice, dislocated his left ankle once, snapped a bone in his left shoulder and sustained at least two documented concussions. He spent one season as a third-string quarterback, appearing at safety on the practice squad, and another completely away from the game and still, each time, he found it harder to stay away than come back. He does not feel a biological imperative to play football. He feels a religious one. “I know what God’s called me to do,” Griffin said. “He’s called me to play football at a high level, inspire men, lead men. That’s why I didn’t have any doubt in what I was doing.” During a training session in the practice complex earlier this year, football coach Bert Whigham walked by Griffin, who was talking to a player preparing for the NFL Draft. “One day football will be done with you,” Whigham heard Griffin tell the prospect, “but you’ll never be done with football.”    “I know what God’s called me to do,” Griffin said. “He’s called me to play football at a high level, inspire men, lead men. That’s why I didn’t have any doubt in what I was doing.” (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)  On the third day of training camp, Griffin ran off the field, swigged from a water bottle and sank down on his right knee next to his wife on Practice Field 1. After the final whistle blew, Griffin had spent about 20 minutes sprinting and throwing corner routes to the end zone, as he always does. Griffin spoke for about 15 minutes with his wife, whose back rested against the goal post. The fields were otherwise empty. A couple of Ravens staffers and the few fans who weren’t scrunched up behind a yellow rope separating the practice field, mostly young boys, stared at Griffin and his wife, then whispered to one another. A group of fans walked by Griffin, and Griffin obliged the oldest man’s request for a picture and autograph. A few moments later, Flacco walked out of a team-facility door. “Oh my God, oh my God!” one of the boys yelled at his seven friends. “Guys, look who it is!” The boys, and everyone else, rushed to Flacco’s side. They clamored for him to stand next to them for the camera and sign their helmets, balls and jerseys. Hearing the commotion, Griffin turned and saw the mob around Flacco. He stared at the starting quarterback, playing the part that once seemed destined to be his, and his face remained blank.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Rick Maese July 30 Email the author   The teams that compete under the Monumental Sports & Entertainment banner are dissimilar in so many ways, and thus, the athletes who compete for Monumental in professional basketball, hockey, indoor football and even video gaming have different medical needs and training regimens. But they’ll now share a medical provider and an innovative new model under a deal that could be one of the most wide-reaching health-care partnerships in professional sports. The Ted Leonsis-run pro sports enterprise announced a 10-year agreement Monday that gives MedStar Health naming rights for three Washington-area practice facilities: the Capitals’ training rinks in Arlington, formerly called Kettler Capitals Iceplex; the new basketball training facility in Southeast Washington that will house the Wizards, the Mystics and the Capital City Go-Go, the city’s new G League team; and the training space used by Wizards District Gaming, the esports team that competes in the NBA 2K League and practices in a facility adjacent to Capital One Arena. “We are thrilled to enter into this innovative partnership with them that will bring MedStar’s unparalleled excellence in health care to every single team in the Monumental Sports family,” Leonsis said in a statement. “We hope that this expanded partnership will help reimagine the way teams in professional sports approach delivering the very best medical care.” The deal was formally announced at a news conference Monday morning in Arlington. Financial terms were not disclosed. Under the naming rights deal, the esports training facility in Chinatown will become the MedStar Wizards District Gaming Studio. The Capitals’ Arlington facility, which has become a popular destination for fans to watch practices and morning skates, will become MedStar Capitals Iceplex. (That facility had been known as Kettler Capitals Iceplex since it opened in the fall of 2006.) And the practice facility at Washington’s new basketball arena, the $65 million project in Ward 8 on the former St. Elizabeths hospital grounds, will be named MedStar Wizards Performance Center. It is expected to open this fall; the arena itself does not yet have a naming rights deal. “We are also very proud to have MedStar join us in bringing their powerful brand to southeast Washington,” Leonsis said. “We are focused on making the MedStar Wizards Performance Center a vibrant part of the community in Anacostia, and we are thrilled to have MedStar partner with us in this effort.” [He quit his State Department job to play video games. Now he’s a star in the NBA’s 2K League.] MedStar Health already provided health-care services and sponsored training camp and practice-jersey patches for the Wizards and Capitals. The new deal encompasses all of the Monumental teams, including its two Arena Football League franchises, and aims to create a novel health-care model, according to Monumental officials. MedStar will establish a council of medical professionals who provide services to the teams. That council will assess, discuss and administer best practices and training techniques for each squad. A single medical director will be appointed to oversee the entire operation.\\xa0The council will meet monthly, alongside trainers, coaches and team executives, to exchange ideas and best practices and to discuss what they’re seeing on each roster and in each discipline. “We think we can get a competitive advantage in treating every sport and every player so they can get to their top-top performance parameters,” Leonsis said at Monday’s news conference. “That’s why this partnership is just so meaningful for us.” Jim Van Stone, Monumental’s president of business operations, said the arrangement is potentially “game-changing,” allowing constant discussion and ensuring that each team will be keep abreast of the most advanced sports medicine regimens, sports training techniques and new technologies. “Having one partner across all properties really allows you to open up the dialogue and the communication on what’s really the most cutting-edge techniques and preparing athletes for peak performance,” he said. “I think the integration of the medical council allows, really, that open dialogue among the teams. Each of the sports we have here at Monumental is just completely different.” MedStar is not the only medical provider to enter into a high-profile agreement with a Washington professional sports team. In 2016, the Redskins renamed their Ashburn headquarters the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park, and the team’s Richmond training camp is sponsored by Bon Secours Health System. But Monumental’s varied holdings could make its new deal more noteworthy. “The collaboration of all these different training teams and medical teams really working together, I think, is really going to put us in a fantastic position,” Van Stone said. “I don’t think there’s another opportunity out there that brings all these different facets under one umbrella.” More sports coverage from The Post: Capitals re-sign forward Tom Wilson to six-year deal Dwight Howard has been the star of the show.

(Nick Wass/Associated Press)   by Neil Greenberg July 30 Email the author   The MLB nonwaiver trade deadline is 4 p.m. Tuesday, and it’s time for the Washington Nationals, who are 52-53 and six games back in the National League East, to face reality and turn free agent contracts into future assets such as prospects and draft picks — and, yes, that includes six-time all-star outfielder Bryce Harper. Harper’s expected contract demands are well-known by now — his price tag projects to be north of $300 million — and with Washington so far in the rear-view mirror of true playoff contenders, it would make a lot of sense for the Nationals to convert Harper into future value. But General Manager Mike Rizzo seemed hesitant to commit to such a move when asked Wednesday by the Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan. [There is only one AL playoff spot up for grabs. Who’s excited?] “It would have to be a spectacular set of circumstances for us to do that,” Rizzo\\xa0said during the segment. “We’re going to do what we have to do to better this team for 2018 and beyond. That’s one of the superstars in the game and he’s a guy that is near and dear to my heart personally, and in Washington D.C., and is one of the great players in the game.” “Great” may be stretching it. Sure, Harper was the unanimous NL MVP in 2015 after an out-of-this-world campaign in which he hit .330 with a major-league leading 1.109 OPS and a league-leading 42 home runs, but that year has been the exception, with his other six seasons in the majors a mixed bag. Injuries limited him to less than a full season in 2014 and 2017, and he hit just .243 with 24 home runs in 147 games in 2016. He did add 21 stolen bases that season, but when looked at through the lens of wins above replacement (3.0 WAR, as calculated by FanGraphs) Harper was just the 12th-best NL outfielder that year. And that’s the kind of production the Nationals can expect if they hold on to Harper beyond Tuesday, at least according to\\xa0Dan Szymborski’s ZiPS projections and Steamer’s estimates for the rest of the season. According to those estimates, adjusted for projected playing time, Harper will hit .270 with 12 home runs, producing an additional 1.6 or 1.7 fWAR through the end of 2018. And that might be optimistic, considering the reasons Harper is struggling this season.    2018 regular season G PA HR R RBI SB AVG OPS fWAR   Bryce Harper (through Sunday) 103 450 25 63 62 8 .220 .842 1.6   ZiPS projections (rest of season) 50 215 12 33 33 4 .268 .923 1.6   Steamer projections (rest of season) 51 223 12 34 33 3 .271 .929 1.7    Harper has been struggling with fastballs, striking out in a career-high 25 percent of his plate appearances ending on that pitch. His walk rate this season is near where it was in 2015 (19.0 percent), but he is having trouble making contact on pitches up and away, lowering his overall OPS on these pitches to .994, compared with 1.117 last season and 1.196 in 2015.    Bryce Harper’s miss rate vs. fastballs in 2018 (TruMedia)  It’s conceivable that Harper makes an adjustment and lays off these pitches entirely during the rest of the season, but there is a more pressing issue: how often the defense has been using an infield shift when Harper is at the plate. The soon-to-be free agent\\xa0has faced\\xa0an infield shift in 192 of his 450 plate appearances (42.7 percent), resulting in a\\xa0batting average on balls in play of .240, leading him to create runs at a rate that is 58 percent lower than the league average after adjusting for league and park effects (42 wRC+). The\\xa0league average for BABIP against the shift is .298 this year, so it’s easy to see how much the shift is costing Harper.    Bryce Harper against the shift in 2018 (MLB)  With results like that, you can expect the shift to be used against Harper more, not less, making 1.7 fWAR over the next few months an optimistic projection. That also suggests the Nationals won’t get the boost they may be anticipating by keeping Harper on the roster. It also puts their playoff chances in serious doubt. [Nationals look listless as trade deadline approaches] Heading into Monday night’s games, Washington has a 42.5 percent chance at making the playoffs — not nearly high enough to justify keeping Harper on the roster past Tuesday’s deadline. It surely would take a lot for Washington to move Harper, and the team probably would only do so if it was certain it would not be able to re-sign him. But if the Nationals get a good enough offer, the smart move probably is to get a solid return on a slugger who more than likely won’t be able to lift his team into the postseason.

(Alex Gallardo/Associated Press)   by Neil Greenberg July 27 Email the author   On Tuesday, Todd Gurley and the Los Angeles Rams agreed to a four-year contract extension with $45 million guaranteed, the largest guarantee ever given to a running back. The deal keeps the AP Offensive Player of the Year in line to wear a Los Angeles uniform through the 2023 season. Gurley is certainly worthy of the historic deal. The first-round pick in the 2015 draft carried the ball 279 times for 1,305 yards and a league-leading 13 touchdowns last season, adding 788 yards and six touchdowns on 64 catches. That made him one of the NFL’s most potent weapons at the position. [At a ‘young’ 34 years old, Redskins QB Alex Smith says ‘my best football’s still ahead of me’] Other rushers took notice — especially Pittsburgh Steelers all-pro running back Le’Veon Bell, who has yet to sign his one-year franchise tender to start what could be his final season with the franchise.

And that could be a mistake.   lol and ppl thought I was trippin?...— Le'Veon Bell (@LeVeonBell) July 24, 2018    Gurley, who turns 24 in August, has a couple of years left in his prime. Bell, at 26, does not. That might sound harsh for players who are only two years apart, but the life span of a running back in the NFL is not long. ESPN’s Bill Barnwell pointed this out, showing how even rushers at the top of the leader board don’t survive much longer than five years.   Put this in the column today but think it’s also worth mentioning in graphical form. Here are the leaders in passing, receiving, and rushing yards from five years ago (2013) per @pfref.

It’s not a perfect measure of a running back’s performance, but it will illustrate how a top-performing running back ages. And it gives extra credit to do-it-all backs like Gurley and Bell, who not only carry the ball but catch passes out of the backfield as well. Since 2000, there have been 31 running backs who played in the NFL at age 21. More than half (17) improved their PPR point total the following year. The same rate of backs improved during their age-22 to age-23 season, and they kept improving until they reached 27. Then we started to see a decline — and it wasn’t a subtle one: Just over one-third of rushers (38 percent) improved their performance from 27 to 28. At 30 or older, the improvement rate slowed even more.     This is why taking a wait-and-see approach with Bell makes sense: Statistically speaking, he has one or two years left in his prime before he starts to decline. The same is true for David Johnson of the Arizona Cardinals. He turns 27 in December and, even through he has less mileage — 573 touches in 33 games over three seasons — his age is still a concern. Over the past decade, the amount of running backs who see 200 or more touches in a season peaks at age 25 and 26 and then starts a steady decline before almost falling off a cliff at age 29 and older. If the Cardinals’ front office decides to give Johnson a long-term deal with guaranteed money that extends into this age range, it is setting itself up for disappointment, as would any franchise in a similar situation.

Martin (@ByKimberleyA) July 26, 2018    However, the absence of weaknesses is countered by a lack of perceived strengths and, as a result, the Redskins are not expected to be competitive in 2018; per the preseason point spreads released by CG Technology in May, Washington is favored in just four games this season, all at home: Week 2 vs. the Indianapolis Colts (-3),\\xa0Week 6 vs. the Carolina Panthers (-1),\\xa0Week 7 vs. the Dallas Cowboys (-1) and\\xa0Week 14 vs. the New York Giants (-1.5). Knowing the point spreads for each week allows us to project how many wins the Redskins will have in 2018. For example, a team that is favored by one point at home can be expected to win 51 percent of the time. Using this method for each of the 16 games of the season estimates Washington is most likely to finish 2018 having earned between five and eight wins, with a 7-9 record the most likely outcome. The Redskins have just a 31 percent chance of finishing 8-8 or better. Skeptical? This also falls in line with the over/under win total set at seven for Washington.     As you would expect, seven or even eight wins won’t be enough to contend for the division title, and it looks like the Redskins will finish last or second to last in the NFC East behind the Philadelphia Eagles and Cowboys.     According to Sharp Sports, Washington has the ninth-toughest schedule, and it will face six of the league’s top 10 toughest opponents. Two other opponents, the Panthers and Cowboys, rank 11th and 12th.    (sharpfootballstats.com)  The most challenging part of the schedule is toward the end of the season, when the Redskins will be on the road against the Cowboys (Week 12), Eagles (Week 13), Jacksonville Jaguars (Week 15) and Tennessee Titans (Week 16). Based on the preliminary point spreads, Washington has less than a 33 percent chance to win each of those games, making the first half of the season that much more important.     As you can see, there is little room for error, with Gruden and his squad needing to make the most of the season’s first half. If not, Washington could flounder more than expected, with the possibility of a four- or five-win season within reach.

The league suspended Wilson for three games, but he returned the following series and continued his hard-hitting play. It was one of three suspensions for him last season. Wilson, who earned $2.25 million last season, was a restricted free agent, meaning the Capitals owned his negotiating rights. He opted not to file for arbitration. Without arbitration, it was possible negotiations could have lasted until training camp. “6 more years in DC!! Love this team and love this city. Beyond excited to stay a part of the Capitals family!” Wilson tweeted. After re-signing defenseman Madison Bowey to a two-year, $2 million deal last week and Brooks Orpik to a one-year $1 million contract Tuesday, Washington had roughly $6.2 million in cap space for the upcoming season. Several industry insiders projected the team would have to pay Wilson between $3.5 million and $4.5 million per year. In that sense, the player might have won this negotiation, but the Caps are locking up a 24-year-old who was their first-round pick in 2012 and has consistently improved. This past season, he spent the majority of his minutes on the top line with captain Alex Ovechkin and also was one of the team’s top penalty-killers. He is perhaps the Capitals’ most physical player, with a well-deserved reputation as the team’s enforcer.

The move ensures the Capitals will return all six defensemen who played for them in the Stanley Cup finals as they claimed the franchise’s first championship, a group that also includes Michal Kempny and John Carlson, each of whom re-signed earlier this offseason. The Capitals had traded Orpik to the Colorado Avalanche, along with goaltender Philipp Grubauer, at the NHL draft to clear Orpik’s $5.5 million salary cap hit from their books, in part to find money to keep Kempny and Carlson. The Avalanche elected to buy out the 37-year-old’s deal, making him a free agent. [The Stanley Cup tracker: Where will the Caps take it next?] “Brooks has been a valuable player and a great mentor for our young players, and we are thrilled to bring him back to our organization,” Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan said. “We feel his leadership and competitiveness on and off the ice will be welcomed back to our group.” Orpik drew criticism as his contract neared its final season, largely because of his lack of speed in a league that increasingly prioritizes the trait. That criticism was amplified given a salary cap hit that made him Washington’s seventh-highest-paid player in terms of annual average value last season. The Capitals’ players, coaches and executives all lauded Orpik’s leadership and attitude, citing it as a key factor in their recent success. The one-year term and $1 million price tag — which could include another $500,000 in performance bonuses — is a far more team-friendly deal, and Orpik again will provide leadership for a roster that figures to incorporate more young players in the coming season. His presence also will make it tougher for some of the team’s defensive prospects — such as Madison Bowey, recently re-signed on a two-year deal, and 2016 first-round draft pick Lucas Johansen — to crack Washington’s lineup.

Bowey was a restricted free agent, and the extension leaves the Capitals with just one player left to sign: right wing Tom Wilson. After Washington drafted Bowey in the second round in 2013, he made his NHL debut this past season, appearing in 51 games with an average ice time of 13:43. Although the 23-year-old didn’t appear in any playoff games, he’s expected to be on the NHL roster again next season, and that it’s a one-way contract for both years of his new deal supports that. The Capitals now have six defensemen under contract, and General Manager Brian MacLellan said adding a veteran blue-liner was a consideration, especially with Bowey and Christian Djoos entering just their sophomore campaigns. MacLellan confirmed Washington was in discussions with veteran Brooks Orpik, whom the team traded to Colorado at the draft in a salary cap-clearing move. The Avalanche bought out the last year of Orpik’s deal, making him an unrestricted free agent. The 37-year-old remains unsigned. “We’re still in discussions with maybe one or two free agents,” MacLellan said July 3. “There’s a trade-off: We think Madison can take the step to the next level, and same with Djoos. They both played well this year, and I think they’re going to improve as we go this year.” Bowey’s contract leaves the Capitals with roughly $7.2 million in cap space, and they have 21 players under contract. Wilson, a restricted free agent, did not elect for arbitration, so it’s unclear how long his contract negotiations might take. His agent, Mark Guy, said this week that, while there has been regular dialogue with Washington, a new deal isn’t “done or close.” The sides are exploring an extension potentially “north of four years,” which could mean an average annual value in the neighborhood of $4 million. Assuming Wilson’s deal gets done, the Capitals, who won the franchise’s first Stanley Cup last month, would be in line to return six of their defensemen from last season as well as their entire top-nine forward corps.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)   by Candace Buckner July 30 Email the author   With the majority of the Washington Wizards’ offseason transactions complete, owner Ted Leonsis said he believes the moves have created perhaps the most balanced roster in franchise history. On Monday, the founder of Monumental Sports & Entertainment reviewed the summer in which the Wizards signed free agents Dwight Howard and Jeff Green and swung a trade for Austin Rivers. Last season, the team regressed amid injuries to John Wall and struggled to play consistently. Washington finished 43-39, earning six fewer wins than it had the previous year, and advanced to the playoffs as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards lost in the first round to the top-seeded Toronto Raptors in six games. In the owner’s view, the offseason renovations should make Washington a force in the East. “If you look at this roster for the Wizards, I think it’s as deep or the deepest team that we’ve ever had,” Leonsis said. “I think that the East will be very competitive, but I don’t think we should be overlooked. I think we’re going to have a really good team this year.” Leonsis, speaking after his Monumental Sports & Entertainment group announced a practice-facility naming-rights partnership with MedStar, said the Wizards addressed specific areas of concern. The Howard signing filled the hole in the middle after the team shipped center Marcin Gortat to the Los Angeles Clippers for Rivers. During his 14-year career, Howard has averaged 17.4 points, 12.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game, and he comes to Washington with the practical price tag of $5.3 million. While Howard, 32, should be an improvement on the older Gortat, he still brings baggage. In consecutive summers, Howard has been dumped by his two previous teams, and over time he has taken blows to his reputation. [Dwight Howard could provide a pick-me-up in the Wizards’ most used play] “I think that’s a media-generated issue. I don’t think it’s a basketball-related issue,” Leonsis said about Howard. “He could’ve signed in many, many places, and really it all comes down to the salary cap. Dwight is paid like a max player. We’re paying him the mid-level exception. He will be a great addition to the team, he wants to be here, and his skill set is what we needed: someone who could run, play defense and rebound. And he’s at the time of his career right now where he’s been paid a lot of money; he’s still getting paid max money [with] the buyout and what we’re paying him. … So, at that price, I think he was the greatest addition we could add at that position.” Although the Wizards lost a bench scorer in Mike Scott, who had the third-highest three-point shooting percentage on the team last year, Leonsis has confidence in veteran reserves Green and Rivers. When asked to evaluate the summer, Leonsis, who also owns the Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals, compared the Wizards to his more successful team. “I thought both front offices had ‘A’ grades for their offseason. I think that when a season ends, you sit down and say, ‘This is what we want to accomplish,’ and for the Wizards, it was we need to have more balance and more depth and be prepared for injuries,” Leonsis said. “We had injuries last year and we want to be able to have interchangeable parts and players that are adapted to the new NBA. “From center position to wing to the backcourt,” Leonsis continued. “So we were able to bring in a lot of bench scoring, and I think we can go 10 to 11 players deep.” Read more: Wizards deleted Team USA photo of John Wall but couldn’t stop him from getting roasted Jerry Colangelo, one of the NBA’s elder statesmen, talks Team USA, the 76ers and more Dwight Howard has been the star of the show.

(Photo by Bob DeChiara/USA Today Sports)   by Candace Buckner July 27 Email the author   During the Washington Wizards’ first game of the Eastern Conference playoffs, Bradley Beal noticed a trend. The Toronto Raptors were alternating defenses when Beal operated as the ballhandler in pick-and-roll plays. They committed, switched and sometimes threw a hard hedge — when the defender on the screener jumps out on the ballhandler to slow down the action. After the Wizards lost Game 1, Beal sought a solution to Toronto’s tactics. “They did a good job of it, but I watched film,” Beal said April 17, the morning before Game 2, “and I think I got some counters that will beat their defenses.” He didn’t. As the Wizards’ ballhandlers tried to create basketball poetry, operating around the occasional hard pick mixed with too many halfhearted screens, the play was perforated as Washington fell into a two-game deficit. Enter one\\xa0of the most active roll men in the NBA. While many have dissected the Wizards’ decision to add Dwight Howard, who was traded from the Charlotte Hornets to the Brooklyn Nets, then negotiated a buyout to become a free agent, his new teammates can focus on the big man’s particular skill set. On a purely basketball front, a healthy Howard may cure Washington’s weaknesses in the pick and roll and improve any blind spots on the fast break. “Some of the narrative is out there that I heard, but I’m not concerned with it,” Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said Monday after Howard was officially introduced. “My focus is on him and what we’ve talked about and our relationship, what we’ll establish going forward.” [Wizards deleted Team USA photo of John Wall but couldn’t stop him from getting roasted] Last season, when the Wizards had a ballhandler blossoming in confidence in Beal; a big man willing to sacrifice his body for screens in Marcin Gortat; and, for only 41 games, the services of a five-time point guard deft in finding teammates in John Wall, the team often relied\\xa0on the pick and roll to create offense. Despite having personnel suited for the play, the Wizards were surprisingly inefficient as a pick-and-roll team. Washington\\xa0ranked below average in plays produced from the pick-and-roll ballhandler, 0.82 points per possession for 19th overall, according to NBA Advanced Stats. And even though Gortat finished fourth in the league in screen assists, the team recorded just 0.98 points per possession (27th in the league) when the action went to the roll man. The bread-and-butter play starts, naturally, with a pick and is designed to create an open shot for the ballhandler or a pass to the cutting screener. The Wizards, however, sometimes found the simple play more difficult, just as Beal experienced in Game 1 against the Raptors. On that night, Beal, who led the team with 510 possessions as the pick-and-roll ballhandler in 2017-18 according to Synergy Sports, often faced an extra defender after a teammate slipped the screen. Although that’s common in the NBA, a hard screen initiates the action, and the threat of the screener finishing near the rim is more likely to keep a defender from hedging the ballhandler. Gortat did not pose such a threat — he made only 45.5 percent of his shots on plays in which he rolled to the basket. Conversely, Howard shot 58.4 percent on the same plays last season for Charlotte. “He’s still athletic,” Wall said about Howard. “Look what he did last year: He averaged 16 and 12. He’s a guy who can still catch lobs and dunk the ball under the basket.” Still, Howard’s work as a roll man graded out as average on Synergy’s rating system. He performed better, however, in transition. The statistical website separately evaluated both Howard and the Wizards as excellent on transition plays, and Brooks already can envision how the big man would be most effective when the team elects to get out and run. [Dwight Howard has been the star of the show. With the Wizards, he’ll be part of the chorus.] “We want to play fast. How do you play fast? You don’t play fast by getting the ball … out through the net,” Brooks said. “You’ve got to get it off the rim and get out and run. He’s the best rebounder in the league, and to be able to do that, it creates offense for our guys that can play fast, that can shoot.” Howard averaged 12.5 rebounds, ranking third in the NBA behind Andre Drummond (16.0) and DeAndre Jordan (15.2), but even when he wasn’t concluding a defensive possession by securing the ball, the 265-pounder still hurried down the floor fast enough to finish many of Charlotte’s breaks. Howard completed 36 of 51 shot attempts in transition (nearly 71 percent) and drew free throws on 26.6 percent of those possessions. On the day of Game 2 between the Wizards and Raptors, Howard was busy in Charlotte holding a Jr. NBA clinic at the Dwight Howard Boys & Girls Club. Howard had missed the playoffs for only the fourth time in his 14-year career, and the Wizards were missing someone with his skills as an efficient roll man and transition scorer. Two months later, after Howard was dealt by the Hornets, he received an Instagram direct message from Wall asking whether he wanted to play in Washington. He said yes. The big man looking for a home found one with a team that needs a pick-and-roll boost. “I think we are going to really just shock a lot of people, and I think for me, the rest of this team and this organization, it’s all about winning. That is our mind-set,” Howard said. “That is the only thing that us as players have been talking about, myself, coach and also Ernie [Grunfeld, the general manager], how we are excited about turning things around here in D.C.” Read more from Post Sports: Alex Smith was a safe choice.

(Steven Goff/The Washington Post)   by Steven Goff July 31 at 2:56 PM Email the author   D.C. United’s Wayne Rooney returned to work Tuesday looking as if he had stepped into a boxing ring over the weekend. Bruises enveloped his left eye, and five stitches ran from the eyebrow to the bridge of his broken nose. “It looks a bit worse with the black eye,”\\xa0he said after participating in the training session, “but it feels fine.” Rooney and the team declared him available for the MLS match Saturday at Montreal, saying he had cleared two concussion tests and would not need significant treatment for the wounds, which were inflicted in the waning moments of a 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rapids on Saturday at Audi Field. Rooney was in the penalty area, helping to defend a corner kick in the fourth of five additional minutes, when Colorado’s Tommy Smith crashed into teammate Axel Sjoberg and created a chain reaction. The back of Sjoberg’s head then rammed Rooney’s face. Rooney fell, and when he got back up, his face was a bloody mess. Medical staff tended to him on the sideline as shorthanded United ran out the clock. “It was a complete accident,” Rooney said. “These things happen.” He said he has broken his nose “a few times” during his 16-year career and that “it’s part of football. I’m used to it.” He said he would be ready to play this weekend — “no problem” — and did not plan to wear a molded face mask. “It will be fine. It’s actually settled down quite quick,” he said. “There’s not much swelling. … I’ve had no problems sleeping. I’ll play as normal. Of course, if I get a bang on it, it will be painful.” United tested him for a concussion after the match and again Tuesday. Results were negative. Still, Coach Ben Olsen said, “We’ll be a little cautious with him this week.” Olsen said Rooney “doesn’t seem too bothered by it. … The thing to worry there is with the concussion stuff. The cuts heal. We all have broken noses; almost every guy out here has one. All of us can only breathe through one nostril. It’s part of the gig.” Rooney’s commitment to the cause, battling an opponent (Sjoberg) with a 10-inch height advantage, left an impression on his teammates. “He took one off the face to make sure nothing happened,” said goalkeeper David Ousted, who was also responsible for preventing Sjoberg from making contact. “It’s the kind of guy he is and the kind of guy we appreciate.” The incident came in Rooney’s first match as team captain, a title awarded after just a month with his new team. “It’s something you know these young players need,” said the former Manchester United and English national team captain. “I’ve been there as a young player. I remember as a young player getting advice from the likes of Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes — it’s what you want to take in if you want to take advice. If you don’t, that’s your decision. I can only be there to help.” The injury also came on the day he scored his first MLS goal, a 33rd-minute strike between goalkeeper Tim Howard’s legs. United conceded Kellyn Acosta’s equalizer in the 82nd minute and went back ahead on an own goal in the 90th. Aside from the injury forcing him to the sideline, Rooney went the distance after totaling 131 minutes in the first three outings. Barring any setbacks this week, Olsen hopes to play him most, if not all, of this weekend’s game. “This was the plan all along, to build him up to this point,” Olsen said. “It’s still a little bit fast, but that’s just the reality of coming in halfway through the season. If this was preseason, maybe it would be another week. He did a very good job in the offseason to maintain a level of fitness where he didn’t come in here unfit.” Rooney added, “I feel like I am up to speed.” His adaptation into the attack remains a promising work in progress as he bonds with Luciano Acosta, Yamil Asad, Zoltan Stieber and Paul Arriola. “We’ve created chances,” Rooney said. “If we had been more clinical in the last game, we could have been two or three-nil up and the game is finished. But it’s nice as an attacking player when you are creating chances. There are real positive signs.” Notes: With eight days left in the transfer and trade window, Olsen said the team is “still looking” for roster help, particularly at outside back. Taylor Kemp, the incumbent at left back, will miss the entire year with a hip injury and first-choice right back Nick DeLeon continues to struggle with a knee injury that has cost him eight games. … The club will offer a free ticket to a future match for fans who were not able to gain entrance to Audi Field last weekend because of a strict clear bag policy. The situation affected about 50 people, spokesman Chris Hull said. “It may be a small number, but it’s far too many,” he said. United implemented the guidelines a year before it will become mandatory at all MLS venues. The team has pledged to improve communication about the policy by prominently posting it on digital game tickets and social media and by stationing customer-service officials at the gates. The team is also reviewing its relationship with a third-party vendor, which did not provide enough lockers for fans to store belongings outside the stadium. Long lines formed Saturday, prompting some fans to leave or stash their bags unprotected outside the stadium. United will also review the $20 charge for a locker and whether to distribute clear bags for free or a minimal charge. The next home match is Aug. 12 against Orlando City.

(Anne-Marie Sorvin/USA Today Sports)   by Steven Goff July 29 Email the author   If Bayern Munich had any second thoughts about spending up to $22 million in transfer fees last week on a Canadian teenage attacker with no MLS goals before this year, they were put to rest in a ferocious and spectacular performance Saturday at Vancouver’s BC Place. Three months and a few days short of his 18th birthday, Alphonso Davies looked very much like someone ready to take the next step in his dawning soccer career and fulfill the massive expectations that are sure to shadow him to Bavaria this winter. He played a part in every Whitecaps goal, scoring twice on breathtaking sequences and assisting twice during a 4-2 victory over Minnesota United. While he was making outrageous runs in the Pacific Northwest, his future employer was in Miami with an American teenager in the starting lineup for a preseason friendly: defender Chris Richards, 18, on loan from FC Dallas. He will play for Bayern’s under-19 squad this season, but this summer Richards has entered as a substitute against Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus and played 90 minutes against Manchester City. Because he is too young for a formal transfer, Davies will remain with the Whitecaps through the end of the season and join Bayern Munich when the German transfer window reopens in January. The fee from the Bundesliga titans — a base of $13 million, with clauses that could result in additional payments — is the largest for an MLS player in the league’s 22-year history, besting the $11.6 million that Spanish side Villarreal spent 10 years ago on Jozy Altidore, then with the New York Red Bulls. The Whitecaps have pledged to pour that money into the sporting side of the club, such as youth development and player acquisitions. “He’s got a massive future, and it’s really up to him how far he goes,” said Minnesota defender Michael Boxall, who was burned by Davies on the first goal. “He’s got a great opportunity ahead of him.” He will carry a compelling personal story with him to Europe: Born in a Ghanaian refugee camp to parents fleeing civil war in Liberia, he relocated with his family to Ontario at age 5 before settling in Alberta. An Edmonton youth club that helped groom him will receive a small share of the Bayern transfer fee, a FIFA-required solidarity payment that MLS’s U.S. teams, citing antitrust laws, ignore. Davies’s career began to take shape in earnest at the Whitecaps’ youth academy three summers ago. Within six months, he had signed with the club’s lower-tier team in the United Soccer League. By the summer of 2016, at age 15, he had upgraded to an MLS contract. With the first team, he started twice in 2016 and nine times last year before becoming a regular this season. With European clubs monitoring him, he has scored five times and posted 10 assists in 21 regular season matches, which earned him a share of fourth place on the league charts entering Sunday’s matches. Davies scored a terrific individual goal against D.C. United in the Audi Field grand opening two weeks ago. He met with Bayern officials last week in Philadelphia, where the German club began a U.S. tour. A deal soon was finalized. He then returned to Vancouver for Saturday’s sensational performance, assisting on Yordy Reyna’s sublime goal in the 35th minute, beating three players in tight space to score in the 56th, setting up Kei Kamara on a two-on-one in the 64th and splitting two defenders and finding the top corner of the net in the 89th.   Simply amazing, @AlphonsoDavies 🙌 pic.twitter.com/Gh48fQZGrx— Major League Soccer (@MLS) July 29, 2018    Putting the Bayern deal to rest and rejoining the Whitecaps, he said, “was a weight off my shoulders after all the travel and meetings.” After a slow start — “the first 20 [minutes were] as bad as I’ve seen him play,” Coach Carl Robinson said — Davies hit his stride. “Another bit of magic,” Robinson said of Davies’s second goal. Davies is making gains on the senior international level as well, making six appearances since he became a naturalized citizen in early 2017 and scoring three goals in Canada’s first two matches at the Concacaf Gold Cup last summer. He was the youngest in tournament history to score, was named the best young player in the event and made the Best XI squad. Canada hasn’t qualified for the World Cup since 1986 and has produced few world-class players. Calgary’s Owen Hargreaves, signed by Bayern Munich in 1999, is an exception, though he opted to play for England on the international level. In Davies, however, the country has a brighter future. “We know he is a wonderful talent,” Robinson said. “We know he’s got ability. He’s got potential, but when he keeps playing like that, that’s not potential — that’s reality.” More on soccer: Wayne Rooney scores first MLS goal as D.C.

In his first start at the new venue, wearing the captain’s armband, Rooney also showed he has no intention of coasting into retirement.

He is a pretty tough guy,” said Coach Ben Olsen, whose dress shirt had been stained with blood after embracing his star forward. “It shows you what this means to him right now. He’s in the box, putting his face on the line, understanding that’s a big moment. We needed that play to get out of that spot.” [Wayne Rooney named D.C. United captain after three MLS matches] Rooney, whose acquisition last month was the priciest in United history, will continue to undergo evaluation. His status for next Saturday’s match at Montreal is unclear. Well before the injury, Rooney had provided the lead by slotting an angled shot between goalkeeper Tim Howard’s legs. He also hit the post in the second half and mixed well with Luciano Acosta, Yamil Asad and Zoltan Stieber in creating danger throughout the night. United failed to put the result out of reach and, after conceding the 82nd-minute equalizer, went ahead in the 90th on an own goal. Ulises Segura, a late sub who this past week returned from a knee injury, crossed from the end line in hope of making something happen. The ball caromed off Colorado’s Niki Jackson and past Howard. [Darren Mattocks is having a career year. The problem? He’s not Wayne Rooney] “It’s never luck,” Segura, a Costa Rican midfielder, said through an interpreter. “Whenever you get in the box like that, you try to hit it as hard as you can. So it either hits one of your teammates or hits a defender and you get something out of it.” Olsen admired his team’s resiliency, saying “to come back and find a goal – okay, it’s a little fortunate – I am very proud of them.” With a third match in eight days and his team struggling to earn points, Olsen shook up the lineup. Kofi Opare and Russell Canouse, both sidelined much of the year with injuries, made their first starts and Junior Moreno was in the lineup for the first time since early June. Canouse, who had been terrific as a sub for three matches, was a force in central midfield for United (4-9-5). “He’s physical. He’s relentless and he’s a fighter,” Olsen said. “It was nice to have that out there tonight because at times we have missed that.” Rooney’s return to the lineup, at the expense of eight-goal scorer Darren Mattocks, was expected all along after he started last weekend at Atlanta and came off the bench in Wednesday’s 1-0 defeat to the New York Red Bulls.   Wayne Rooney opens his MLS account! #DCvCOL https://t.co/XuKvh1sVea— Major League Soccer (@MLS) July 29, 2018    United set the terms in the first half, but thanks to a suspect call, Colorado (4-12-5) had the first genuine opportunity with a 26th-minute penalty kick. With a challenge from behind on Edgar Castillo, Moreno might have nicked the outside back’s heel. Castillo went airborne. Referee Ramy Touchen was convinced. The video assistant referee did not intervene. Acosta, a U.S. national team midfielder acquired last week from Dallas, stung the penalty kick off the right post. After the scare, United returned to form and went ahead on a well-crafted goal. Moreno won a tackle in the center circle. Stieber linked with Luciano Acosta, who spotted Rooney making a run and supplied a fine ball into the box. Rooney let the ball do the work, using a clever sidestep to put defender Tommy Smith off-balance. As Howard came off his line, Rooney used his first touch to place an angled, eight-yard bid between the charging goalkeeper’s legs. Rooney and Howard had been Manchester United teammates for two\\xa0years and Premier League opponents for 10 before Howard moved to MLS in 2016. United was the better side for most of the night but couldn’t expand the lead. In a three-minute span early in the second half, D.C. had three prime opportunities to extend the lead: Acosta’s cheeky footwork led to a tight-angled shot over Howard and off the top of the crossbar; Howard made a hand save on Rooney’s threat, pushing it off the back post; and Rooney’s heavy touch in the box allowed Howard to smother the ball before a shot attempt. United’s inability to score again came back to haunt it when Jack McBean played a diagonal ball to Kellyn Acosta blazing into the box on the right side. David Ousted charged off his line, but Acosta chipped it over both the goalkeeper and leaping defender Steve Birnbaum. United was crestfallen, a disappointing draw seemingly inevitable. But a hopeful cross reversed its fortunes again and provided a badly needed three points. “For confidence and morale, a win was important,” Opare said. “The results haven’t been great, but we believe in each other. And to bounce back from their goal shows the character of this group.” United notes: Midfielder Paul Arriola served a one-game suspension for yellow-card accumulation. … D.C. will visit the Montreal Impact next weekend before returning home Aug. 12 to face Orlando City.

(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)  Darren Mattocks is enjoying the most productive season in his seven-year pro career — and the campaign is only half over. In his first summer in Washington, the Jamaican forward shares D.C. United’s scoring lead with eight goals, an average of one every other appearance, and has helped lift an attack that last seas matched the MLS record for scoreless games. Mattocks, however, plays the same position as Wayne Rooney, the English superstar who arrived this month to bolster the organization both on and off the field. As Ben Olsen said, “We didn’t get Wayne to come off the bench for 15-20 minutes.” [Rooney named United’s team captain after three matches in MLS] And so the coach has had to strike a tricky balance of integrating Rooney while providing enough minutes to Mattocks to sustain both his production and spirit. “It’s a work in progress, if I am being honest,” Mattocks said Friday. “It’s not perfect. That’s pretty much all I can say.” Before Rooney’s arrival, Mattocks started 12 matches, entered as a sub once and did not play once while compiling all of his goals, including five in a recent six-game stretch for last-place United (3-9-5). Since Rooney’s arrival, he has not scored in two starts (in which he gave way to Rooney shortly after intermission) or as a second-half sub for his new teammate. Rooney is likely to start Saturday against the Colorado Rapids at Audi Field and, as his fitness level continues to grow, he is almost certain to become Olsen’s first choice in a system designed for one striker only. “It’s not an easy situation for Darren. I feel for him,” Olsen said. “However, this is professional soccer and he is going to have to do the best he can with the situation. .\\u2009.\\u2009.\\xa0It’s a tough adjustment. There is only so much I can say to him because in a lot of ways it isn’t fair.” Mattocks vented a bit Wednesday after leaving the field in the 57th minute, noticeably frustrated by the early removal. “He doesn’t want to be subbed. I understand his frustration, and some of it is warranted,” Olsen said. “But this is our new reality: How you deal with the circumstances is the important thing. I trust Darren’s character. He is a team guy and ultimately wants what is best for himself but for this team. There is enough of a foundation between us and in him to deal with this in the right way.” In talking about the situation Friday, Mattocks seemed to carry a mix of disappointment and understanding. “If you are looking long term, it’s going to affect my output if I get less playing time,” he said. “The more I play, the more I score. The first half of the season, I’ve been doing it. With Wayne coming in, overall it’s good for the team, but maybe I am going to be affected the most. “It’s tough to keep everyone happy in this situation. You have got to understand the business aspect of it — what he brings to the table — but at the same time, it doesn’t keep everyone happy. For the team’s sake, you have to put the team first.” Beyond the goals, Olsen has admired Mattocks’s attitude and work rate. “He’s a lovely guy,” Olsen said. “The way he has come in here and helped us in the goal department, but also he has worked harder than he has ever worked in his career. He has given us everything he has had and we expect him to continue to do it.” Even if he does lose the starting job, Mattocks will remain in Olsen’s plans. Rooney is on the back end of his career and won’t play 90 minutes every game, especially when United faces three matches in a week (as the team will have to do four more times). Olsen said his message to Mattocks is: “Take advantage of those minutes, so you can make my life difficult and lean toward putting you on with Wayne. Make it so I can’t keep you out of the lineup.” Olsen will stick with his one-forward alignment for the time being but has not ruled out a change that would partner Mattocks and Rooney on the front line or put Mattocks up front and Rooney in a withdrawn position. “Right now, I don’t think we’re there,” he said of a possible new formation. “We’re still trending in the right direction [in creating opportunities]. We have to see how this looks before we make any adjustments.” As for Rooney’s position, “We haven’t come to a conclusion yet where Wayne is going to play permanently for this team.” Olsen then added, “but the reality is, he is going to play.” United notes: D.C. remains in the market for defensive help, especially on the corners, before the transfer and trade window closes Aug. 8, Olsen said. .\\u2009.\\u2009.

(Annie Rice/AP)  CHICAGO — Before DJ Durkin discussed the upcoming season, a brewing quarterback competition and the benefit of recruiting local talent, the Maryland coach squinted into a row of bright lights, held both sides of a glass lectern and addressed what is heavily weighing on his football program as a new campaign nears. “Good to be here this morning. Good to see everyone. Marks the start of a new season. Great day. Appreciate you being here,” Durkin said to start his opening remarks at Big Ten media days Tuesday. Then he took a deep breath, arched his eyebrows and spoke a little softer than before. “I’d like for us to talk about the upcoming season, but just take a moment to share some thoughts on Jordan McNair and what he meant to our program, the type of teammate he was,” Durkin continued, referencing the Maryland offensive lineman who died June 13, two weeks after he was hospitalized following an organized team workout. “Obviously the loss of Jordan has been a tremendously difficult thing for our entire program to deal with this summer.” Durkin stood in front of a couple hundred reporters inside a Marriott conference room in downtown Chicago. Next will come the Terrapins’ first day of training camp at the end of next week, then their season opener against Texas at FedEx Field on Sept. 1, then their home opener two weeks later. All of that, like Tuesday, will carry the sadness and unease of McNair’s death. [Scott Frost is ready to get Nebraska ‘back where it belongs’] Earlier this month, McNair’s family announced that the 19-year-old lineman’s death was caused by heatstroke. They have also hired the law firm that represented the family of Freddie Gray, the Baltimore man who died in 2015 after being injured while in police custody, and are exploring their legal options. Durkin, who was at the workout with the rest of the Maryland coaching staff, declined to provide further details of that day while Maryland is still participating in an external review. The external review opened in the third week of June and could last 60 more days, according to a timeline provided by a university spokeswoman when it began. The review is being conducted by Walters Inc., an athletic training consulting firm. In addition to looking into McNair’s death, the review is evaluating\\xa0the football program’s procedures and protocols related to “planning and conducting team conditioning and practice sessions; and for responding to health emergencies during or after those sessions.” Durkin said Tuesday that he and Terrapins coaches and players have not yet been interviewed as part of the review but that Walters Inc. has made a list of people with whom to speak. Durkin did say that Maryland has already made adjustments in response to what led to McNair’s hospitalization May 29. “There’s things that we immediately put into place and looked at,” Durkin said Tuesday. “And then obviously through our external review there will be things long-term-wise that we’ll continue to change and adapt to.” “Just being more cognizant of all the things we are doing with our guys,” he said when asked what specific changes have been made so far. “Being aware of their hydration levels, being aware of communicating out on the field, all those things we’ve looked at and we made adjustments already with that. We’ll continue to make adjustments.” Maryland has offered a loose timeline of the day McNair was hospitalized and said the workout was designed and supervised by the team’s strength and conditioning staff. The university has also noted that athletic trainers were present throughout. The workout began at about 4:15 p.m. with the temperature around 80 degrees, according to the university. An initial 911 call was made at 5:57, according to an incident report written by Prince George’s County medical responders and obtained by The Washington Post through a public records request. That call, made by an unidentified man, indicated that McNair was “hyperventilating,” and the university has said McNair had trouble recovering from a conditioning test consisting of a series of 110-yard sprints. Medical responders arrived five minutes after the initial call. A second call at 6:07 p.m. indicated that McNair might have been having a seizure, a known symptom of heatstroke. McNair arrived at Washington Adventist Hospital in nearby Takoma Park at 6:36 p.m. and was airlifted to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore that night. He died 15 days later. “It’s definitely tough going into camp with what happened to Jordan,” Maryland offensive tackle Derwin Gray said Tuesday. “I don’t really want to get too detailed into what happened and things like that, but Jordan was a great guy. Jordan was a big guy with a big heart, and he loved to smile. He came to work every day, never complained, and I feel like he left a great message to us without even saying it: Hang around your teammates. Smile. Enjoy what you do together. “And most importantly, whether it’s a coach to a player, or player to player, or coach to coach, just telling each other, ‘I love you.’ Because you never know with this game we’re playing, anything can happen. So that’s what I take from the situation.” Now the Maryland football team\\xa0is deciding how to best honor McNair this season, and Durkin said Tuesday that a group of players is leading that discussion. “Jordan and his family will always be part of what we do,” Durkin said. “We’ve assigned a player committee to head that up and make sure that there’s always a presence. We’re a team playing for Jordan this year. So there will be some things we’ll announce in the coming days as we get into the season of what exactly we’re going to do and how we’re going to handle that.” More college sports coverage from The Post: UNC’s Larry Fedora, who questioned football’s link with CTE, finds backers at Fox Sports and Yahoo Brewer: Fedora’s defensive crouch is as dangerous to football’s future as concussions At ACC media days, Louisville football addresses latest scandal involving athletic department ', 'Maryland football coach addresses Jordan McNair death at Big Ten media days - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/terrapins-insider/wp/2018/07/16/heatstroke-caused-death-of-maryland-offensive-lineman-jordan-mcnair-his-family-announces/': ('by Jesse Dougherty July 16 Email the author       Maryland offensive lineman Jordan McNair died last month from heatstroke suffered during an organized team workout May 29, his family wrote on a website launched for a foundation they have started in his honor. McNair died June 13 at 19 years old. Maryland declined to provide McNair’s cause of death at a news conference June 14, citing respect for the privacy of McNair’s family. The school is participating in an external review of the situation conducted by Walters Inc., an athletic training consulting firm. The review is evaluating Maryland’s procedures and protocols related to McNair’s death. It is also evaluating the football program’s procedures and protocols related to “planning and conducting team conditioning and practice sessions; and for responding to health emergencies during or after those sessions,” according to a university spokesman. The review started at the end of the third week in June, and a university spokeswoman said then that it could require up to 90 days. The Jordan McNair Foundation, started by McNair’s parents, Tonya Wilson and Martin McNair, aims to “promote awareness, educate, and advocate for parents and student athletes about heat-related illnesses at youth, high school, and collegiate levels,” according to the “Our Mission” page of the website. The site includes an essay written by Martin McNair titled, “Jordan’s Journey: A Letter From a Father.” “Our plans did not include his death. Our plans included something more. Our plans included him,” Martin McNair wrote after detailing his son’s path to becoming a highly sought-after Division I football recruit out of Randallstown, Md., and eventually an offensive lineman for the Terrapins. “But God had other plans. Jordan gave us 19 great years, and we will miss him. He was a great son, grandson, cousin, nephew, brother, friend, student, roommate and teammate.” “While Jordan is not with us to build his legacy, as a family we are doing it for him. This is his legacy,” Martin McNair continued in the essay. “We ask but one thing, that you join us in keeping Jordan’s name and legacy alive by supporting The Jordan McNair Foundation (T.J.M.F.).” McNair was hospitalized following a team workout May 29 at the program’s outdoor practice facility. The workout was designed and supervised by the Maryland strength and conditioning staff, and certified athletic trainers were present throughout, according to an account provided by the university. Maryland Coach DJ Durkin was also at the workout, which began around 4:15 p.m. McNair, who was listed as 6-foot-4 and 325 pounds, had trouble recovering after completing a series of 110-yard sprints, a standard conditioning test, and received medical attention. McNair soon was transported to the team’s practice facility and later airlifted to\\xa0R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore at approximately 6 p.m., according to the university’s timeline of that day. He received a liver transplant, according to a GoFundMe page created June 6 to support his family. He died 15 days after he was initially hospitalized. The foundation’s website lists three programs: “Breaking Chains/the Jordan McNair Training Facility,” “The Jordan McNair Scholarship Fund,” and “My Body, My Safety: Player Safety 101.” The third program is looking to educate athletes, parents and coaches on heat-related illnesses in a handful of ways. One way is to “Educate students on heat-related illnesses and the stages of heatstroke.” Another is to “Partner with medical professionals to educate student athletes about their bodies and how to know when enough is enough.” Read more Maryland coverage: Many questions remain unanswered in death of Maryland player Jordan McNair Maryland basketball subpoenaed in college basketball corruption probe Damon Evans takes over as Maryland athletic director after two-month search led back to him Maryland Athletic Director Damon Evans will make $720,000 a year, before bonuses ', 'Heatstroke caused death of Maryland offensive lineman Jordan McNair, his family announces - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/terrapins-insider/wp/2018/07/13/maryland-athletic-director-damon-evans-will-make-720000-a-year-before-bonuses/': ('Damon Evans at his introductory news conference on June 26.

The contract, obtained by The Washington Post through a public records request, runs from July 2 to June 30, 2024. It carries a base annual salary of $600,000. Evans will also be paid $120,000 of supplemental annual income for media appearances, his participation in Maryland’s apparel deals, and for making promotional and fundraising appearances on behalf of the university. Maryland will receive all revenue generated by any of the activities tied to Evans’s supplemental income, according to the contract, the $120,000 will be paid in equal installments on Dec. 1 and June 1 of each contract year. Evans then has the opportunity to make up to $45,000 in annual bonuses. Fundraising, one of his noted skills as an administrator, can make him $15,000 in bonuses. He will be paid an additional $7,500 at the end of each year in which the “number of Terrapin Club memberships has exceeded the previous year’s total by 5 percent,” according to the contract.\\xa0 The Terrapin Club is made up of athletic department donors. Evans can also be paid an additional $7,500 in fundraising bonuses for each year in which total athletic department donations exceed the previous year’s total by 5 percent or more. The rest of the potential bonuses are tied to athletic performance. The annual Directors Cup competition ranks colleges based on their aggregate success across athletic programs. The higher Maryland finishes in the final standings, the more money Evans can make as a result: $25,000 if Maryland ranks between first and fifth; $15,000 if it ranks between sixth and 10th; $10,000 if it ranks between 11th and 20th; and $5,000 if it ranks between 21st and 30th. Lastly, Evans will make an additional $5,000 at the end of each year Maryland has 10 or more teams play in NCAA-sanctioned postseason competition. If Evans were terminated without cause before June 30, 2019 (the end of the first year of his contract), Maryland would face a $5 million buyout. If he were terminated without cause on July 1, 2019, or anytime thereafter, he will continue to collect his base salary for the remainder of his initial contract term. Evans resigned as the athletic director at the University of Georgia in July of 2010 following a DUI arrest. Maryland is hoping Evans is a stabilizing presence in a trying time for the athletic department. Evans was Maryland’s interim athletic director after Kevin Anderson went on sabbatical last October, and was officially named full-time athletic director eight months later, in part because he is familiar with the challenges that lie ahead. The university is conducting an external review following the June 13 death of sophomore football player Jordan McNair, who was hospitalized following an organized team workout on May 29. The review started at the end of the third week in June and could take up to 90 days to complete, according to the university. The review includes an independent evaluation, conducted by the athletic training consulting firm Walters Inc., of Maryland’s “planning and conducting team conditioning and practice sessions; and for responding to health emergencies during or after those sessions.” The university also recently released two subpoenas it received from a federal grand jury in New York in conjunction with the Department of Justice’s probe into college basketball. Then there are the usual athletic director challenges — filling out his staff, fundraising for the school’s new indoor football facility, athletic performance — that Evans will have to juggle as he moves closer to his first academic year in charge.

(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)   by Jesse Dougherty June 26 Email the author   Damon Evans walked through the line of Maryland coaches and offered each a varied greeting: a firm handshake for men’s basketball’s Mark Turgeon, a pat on the shoulder for football’s DJ Durkin, a hug for field hockey’s Missy Meharg, and so on. This was just after Evans was officially announced as Maryland’s athletic director Tuesday morning. Cameras clicked inside a ballroom of The Hotel at the University of Maryland in College Park. Each embrace included a smile and some form of congratulations. The introduction of an athletic director is usually a chance for coaches to meet the new boss, feel them out, put a face to a name they’ve been hearing for weeks. This was not that. Evans has headed the athletic department for about eight months. “You got to get to know a person to really understand who they are,” Evans said Tuesday of how his familiarity with the athletic department and search committee may have helped him get hired. “In order to do that you build those relationships. That will speak for itself. I do think that helped me out.” Maryland has not had a permanent athletic director since Kevin Anderson went on sabbatical last October. It has had the 48-year-old Evans, who filled the interim role and was officially promoted on Monday. Maryland paid Turnkey Search $120,000 to aid in the process from April 24 to Aug. 22, according to a contract obtained by The Washington Post through a public records request. The decision came just after the midway point of that initial time frame. There is skepticism among multiple high-level donors that a two-month search could organically produce a hire who’s been with the university since 2014 as Anderson’s second-in-command. But Maryland President Wallace D. Loh, as well as two members of an internal search committee, repeatedly expressed that Evans is the “right person at the right time” for an athletic department facing a number of challenges. “It was an open and national search,” Loh said Tuesday to emphasize that Evans was not grandfathered into the job without an extensive competition. Loh added that Maryland interviewed six candidates for the opening, though he did not specify who they were beyond\\xa0Evans and two other previously reported candidates, Temple Athletic Director Patrick Kraft and former Tennessee AD John Currie. “That is just the way it turned out,” Loh continued after saying that approximately two-thirds of the major searches he’s conducted as president have led to outside hires. “I think anyone who is taking a major, senior role has to compete against everybody who qualifies. And the fact is that [Evans] may have an advantage because he’s well-known, but very often in academia, people don’t hire from the inside, they hire from the outside because there is too much baggage [with the internal candidate] if they have made tough decisions.” Evans is not free of baggage, from both before and during his time at Maryland. In 2004, he was named athletic director at University of Georgia, where he played wide receiver from 1988 to 1991. That made him the first African American athletic director in Southeastern Conference history. He held that role until 2010, when he resigned following a DUI arrest and started a four-year run in the private sector. Anderson — who officially resigned as Maryland’s athletic director in April and is now the interim AD at Cal State-Northridge — gave Evans a second chance in 2014. Maryland’s latest issue is the death of football player Jordan McNair. McNair was rushed to the hospital following an organized team workout on May 29 and died on June 13. The cause of his death has not been announced. He was 19. Multiple people with knowledge of the hiring process believed McNair’s death hurt Evans’s chances of being named athletic director. But two of those people also thought Evans’s familiarity with the ongoing internal and external reviews into McNair’s death made him fit to guide Maryland through them. When asked why the university did not wait until the conclusion of the external review to name a new AD, Loh said: “I don’t know how long that review is going to take. They are bringing in an outside reviewer and so on, and that may take a while.” The university said on June 19 that the external review, which started at the end of last week, “could take up to 90 days.” It also believed by a number of people with knowledge of the hiring process that Evans has had Loh’s support since Anderson departed. Loh did not deny that Tuesday, but insisted that Evans, a skilled public speaker and noted fundraiser, won an open competition. “I think somebody from the inside has a higher hurdle to surmount,” Loh said, and now it is Evans’s job to help Maryland jump over a bunch more.

But now we have this opportunity to make other parents’ days different,” Miller’s wife, Morgan Beck Miller, said in a “Today” show interview that aired Monday morning. Emeline, known as Emmy, was 19 months old when she died June 10, the day after falling into a neighbor’s pool in Southern California in an accident her father said happened “in the blink of an eye.” It had been an ordinary day, Emmy’s mom, a professional beach volleyball player, recalled in the tearful interview. “Every morning, the kids would go swimming and Bode would go swimming with them, and they’d be in there for hours. And they loved it,” Morgan Miller said. After attending a birthday party, Morgan and Emmy stopped at home, where Bode was leaving to take his oldest daughter to a softball game.\\xa0(The couple has a son together and is expecting another child in October; Bode Miller has two children from other relationships.) “He was loading up the car when we got back and I gave him a kiss. And out of nowhere, [Emmy] leaned over and gave him another kiss. And we were so amused by her reaction because it was not typical of Emmy,” Morgan said. “So I kissed him again and she did it again and we laughed. Then I turned around and I walked inside and she waved and said bye to her dad.” She and her children then headed for their neighbors’ home. “We go over, back and forth, multiple times a week. They’re family to us,” Morgan said. “And it was just a normal day over there. We sat on the sofa, and she played in front of us.” With other kids playing nearby, “Emmy would go back and forth, which was all of 15 feet. And all of a sudden, it was just too quiet for me. We’re in mid-conversation and I stood up. And I turned and I went right to where the boys were and I said, ‘Where’s Emmy?’ ” Emmy’s father, an Olympic gold medalist in Alpine skiing, described her as “a bear” who “had such a powerful bull-like personality where she just did what she wanted.” That made the silence even more alarming. “Before Nate [their son] could respond, I turned around and the door that leads to the backyard, that was closed, had this tiny sliver of light coming through the side,” Morgan Miller said. “And my heart sank and I opened the door and she was floating in the pool. And I ran and I jumped in.” She started CPR, and the neighbor called 911. Although it initially appeared as if the baby might survive, “the doctor said her brain had just not had enough oxygen for too long of a time,” Bode Miller said. The Millers’ story is one that is familiar to all too many parents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified drowning as\\xa0the leading cause of death from unintentional injuries for children aged 1 to 4. The Millers had taken precautions, making sure their pool is surrounded by a fence. Now, they want to raise awareness. “We have the choice to live our days with purpose,” Morgan Miller said, “to make sure that no other parent has to feel what we’re feeling.”       We want to thank our friends, family and every one of you who sent a message, said a prayer or donated for the overwhelming expression of support - we are truly touched and blessed. Our midwives started a gofundme campaign to raise funds and we intend to donate these funds raised to worthwhile causes connected to water safety education. We are inspired to make our baby girls memory go forth and help prevent as many drownings as possible. We will post more soon on our plans and efforts.

We’re going to start on page 420 of the Mets’ media guide, the postseason section. The first page of the postseason section is the 1969 League Championship Series, Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets.” For the next six minutes, Cohen and his broadcast partners, Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez, stopped calling the ugly action on the field and read directly from the media guide. It was a history lesson from happier times for the Mets, and it was brilliant.    (Via MLB.tv)  “In the club’s first-ever trip to the postseason, the Mets swept the best-of-five series versus Atlanta, three games to none,” Cohen began as the theme from “Masterpiece Theatre” played in the background. “In Game 1, trailing 5-4 in the top of the eighth, New York rallied for five runs and a 9-5 win. Tom Seaver struggled, allowed five runs in seven innings, but earned the victory. In Game 2, two-run home runs by Tommie Agee, Ken Boswell and Cleon Jones lifted the Mets to an 11-6 win. In front of 54,195 fans at Shea — I might add, parenthetically, I was one of them — New York advanced to the World Series with a 7-4 victory in Game 3. The lead changed hands three times before Wayne Garrett’s two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth put the Mets ahead 5-4. Nolan Ryan hurled seven innings in relief to pick up the win and complete the sweep. Boswell hit .333 with two home runs and five RBI, while Agee batted .357 with two home runs and four RBI. Hank Aaron cracked a home run in each game and drove in seven runs for the Braves. We’re going to move to page 422.” “Is it my turn to read?” Darling asked as the music continued to play and the booth continued to ignore whatever was happening on the field. “Page 422, if you have it at home, folks. This is the 1969 World Series, the Baltimore Orioles versus the Mets. The Mets, of course, won the series, 4-1. The New York Mets entered the 1969 World Series as heavy underdogs against Baltimore. After failing in Game 1, The Amazins rattled off four straight wins to earn their first championship just eight years after the franchise was born.” “It’s like a Seder,” Cohen said before Darling eventually passed the book to Hernandez. “A raucous Shea crowd of 56,335 watched the Mets shut out Baltimore, 5-0, in Game 3,” Hernandez said. “Tommie Agee hit a leadoff home run off Jim Palmer, the only leadoff home run the Hall of Famer would ever allow, to put the Mets on the board early.” [After a stress-packed deadline day, Nats hammer Mets in a laugher] Cohen wrapped up the impromptu story time by reading the guide’s account of the Mets’ World Series-clinching win on Oct. 16, 1969. By this point, there was one out in the inning and a runner on first. “Behind a 5-3 victory, New York’s lovable losers were champions,” he said. “The Orioles led 3-0 early, but home runs by [Donn] Clendenon and [Al] Weis tied the game. In the eighth, [Ron] Swoboda gave the Mets the lead with an RBI double. [Jerry] Koosman induced future Mets manager Davey Johnson to fly out to Cleon Jones in left field for the final out. Jones (Sport Magazine) and Weis (Baseball Writers of America) were the series MVPs. And so concludes page 422, the 1969 World Series.”  \\ufeff  Cohen and Co. previously passed the time during the late innings of yet another Mets loss by reading from the media guide\\xa0on July 10. Here are a few numbers from Tuesday’s game that would make good fodder for a future “Media Guide Musings” segment, perhaps as early as Wednesday’s matinee at Nationals Park. 7: Runs in the first inning for the Nationals, the most in the first inning by a National League team this season.

They ran back the opening kickoff— New York Mets (@Mets) July 31, 2018    1876: The last time a team held an opponent scoreless through five innings while scoring at least 19 runs, according to Elias Sports. It would have been fun to listen to Cohen, Darling and Hernandez read an account of the Hartford Dark Blues’ walloping of the New York Mutuals 142 years ago.

With the Mets trailing, 19-1, and not interested in burning any more relievers, Manager Mickey Callaway tapped shortstop Jose Reyes to make his pitching debut. The 35-year-old Reyes didn’t fare well, but he managed to provide a few laughs, including after he wound up to throw his first pitch before Zimmerman had even stepped into the batter’s box.

The Nationals’ first baseman grinned as he returned to the dugout. Reyes smiled, too, for his ERA was a sparkling 0.00. That wouldn’t last. The Nationals tagged Reyes for six runs on five hits in the inning and batted around, giving Zimmerman another chance with two outs and Wilmer Difo on third base following an RBI triple.    (Via MLB.tv)  As Reyes’s teammates giggled from the top step of the dugout, Zimmerman swung through a couple of curveballs in his second plate appearance against the veteran shortstop. After Zimmerman fouled off another slow offering, Reyes “plunked” Zimmerman’s left leg with a 54 mph curveball that didn’t curve and probably didn’t leave a mark. Zimmerman stood frozen for a moment, looked up, wiggled his butt and then faked as if he were about to charge the mound before flashing a huge smile and walking to first base.

(Via MLB.tv)  “When you get on the mound, before you throw a pitch, it’s fun,” Reyes, who got Juan Soto to fly out to retire the side, said after the game. “But when you start to see people hit a homer and stuff, you get more serious. Even though I’m not a pitcher, I don’t want to see that. I want to throw zeros out there, but like I said, I did the best that I can.” Read more on the Nationals: ‘Is it my turn to read?’: Mets’ TV broadcast gets weird during 25-4 loss to Nats Brandon Kintzler on rumors of clubhouse leaking: ‘That’s an interesting accusation’ Trea Turner, in a tearful news conference, takes ‘full responsibility’ for his past tweets Sean Doolittle: ‘There’s no place for racism, insensitive language or even casual homophobia’ Svrluga: When an athlete’s ugly tweets hit home, ‘it feels like an actual gut-punch’ \",\n",

The moments with which these contributors fill those days are of their own choosing. But all of those moments were earned through the trial and toil of the past season, one that led to the first title in Washington Capitals franchise history. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Jason Franson/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nBraden Holtby\\nDay 30 | Lashburn, Saskatchewan\\nRoughly 5,000 fans lined up outside the Lashburn Sportsplex in Saskatchewan on Tuesday for the opportunity to snap a photo with hometown hero Braden Holtby and the Stanley Cup, the trophy the Capitals’ netminder had talked about winning since he learned to skate in the tiny farm town of Marshall about 10 miles to the northwest. \\n\\n \\n\\nHoltby signed autographs for three hours at the rink where he first played organized hockey and where a display commemorating his journey from Lashburn to juniors in Saskatoon to the NHL adorns one of the walls. It was the Lloydminster-native’s way of giving back to the place and community that shaped him into the Holtbeast he’s become. \\n“I never really thought twice about it,” Holtby told the My Lloydminster Now website of how he would spend his day with the Cup. “I grew up playing in Lashburn, that’s where I learned how to play and my dad coached basically every team I played for here. It was just a big part of our life growing up. It was nice to bring it back to your roots and I thought the town deserved it.”\\nOn Monday evening, Holtby, who regularly returns to Saskatchewan in the summer, posed for a photo with several family members, including his mom and dad, his wife, Brandi, their two kids, Ben and Belle, and the Stanley Cup in front of a grain elevator in Marshall. \\n\\n \\n\\nIt had been nearly two months since Holtby helped the Capitals clinch their first title in franchise history after an exhilarating postseason run that began with the 2016 Vezina Trophy winner on the bench. Philipp Grubauer outplayed Holtby for much of the regular season and earned the starting nod from Coach Barry Trotz in Washington’s first-round series against Columbus. But after the Capitals fell behind two-games-to-none, Trotz turned to Holtby in search of a spark. Holtby provided one, posting a .935 save percentage and a 1.92 goals-against average in Washington’s next four games, all of them wins. \\nThe soft-spoken and fashion-conscious goalie, who wore a cowboy hat, an unbuttoned shirt over a T-shirt and Birkenstocks on Tuesday, got stronger as the playoffs wore on and was at his best when his team needed him most. With the Capitals facing elimination in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Tampa Bay, Holtby made 24 saves for his first playoff shutout since 2016. Two nights later, he turned away all 29 shots he faced to help the Capitals advance to the Stanley Cup finals for only the second time.\\nHoltby was also responsible for one of the defining moments of the Capitals’ title run -- a play that will be talked about for years to come and, frankly, would look terrific painted on the side of Marshall’s grain elevator or the Lashburn Sportsplex. With Washington protecting a one-goal lead in the waning seconds of Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals, Holtby dove across the crease to stop Alex Tuch’s one-timer, which was bound for the back an apparently wide-open net.\\n\\n\\n\\nBraden Holtby cuts a Stanley Cup cake made by his cousin Janet Rogers, left. (Jason Franson/For The Washington Post)\\n\\n“Thank God he’s our goalie,” Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin said afterward.\\nAfter his low-key morning spent signing autographs in Lashburn, Holtby made a stop at the Lloydminster Animal Hospital.

Oshie\\nDay 23 | Warroad, Minnesota\\nT.J. Oshie landed at the small airport in Warroad, Minnesota – also known as Hockeytown, USA – around 9:30 local time on Tuesday morning. A police escort, complete with a community firetruck, waited for him. This was perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Washington Capitals forward to bring the Stanley Cup back to his hometown, and he wanted to do it in style. So he loaded his young family into a 1933 Lincoln limo, top down so he could wave and lift the Cup as the classic car made its way along Highway 33. The town’s massive digital billboard greeted him with a message – “Welcome Home, 77” – and included a photo of Oshie hoisting the cup. Now he was doing it in the flesh. \\nMost of the city’s youth players, along with hundreds of others, arrived at the arena in which Oshie starred in high school to see him with the Cup. The trophy wouldn’t have been there had it not been for one of their favorite sons. Oshie was a cornerstone of the Capitals’ championship run, a run that began with questions of whether or not Oshie was playing hurt. Early in the playoffs, he wasn’t even skating with the team in practices. \\nBut he played in every game. He scored 21 points and displayed a knack for elevating his offense at opportune times. He had six of his 13 goals on power plays alone; he scored goals in two of the final three games of the second-round series win over Pittsburgh, had two goals in a do-or-die Game-6 win over Tampa Bay in the Eastern Conference Finals and a goal and an assist in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals against Vegas. Those were crucial performances. Moreover, it was his usual feistiness and countless big hits that set the tone for a team that simply wouldn’t be denied.\\n\\n \\n\\nThere were other memorable moments off the ice during the run; Oshie endeared himself with his fan base by riding Washington’s Metro to Game 3 and 4 of the final series. He emotionally paid tribute to his father, who coached him growing up and has been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s, on the Vegas ice after the team won the Cup. And he was one of the more colorful personalities during the celebration back in Washington, making a habit out of chugging beers through the filter of his jersey pulled over his face, including as he delivered his address after the title parade. The party continued on Tuesday in Warroad. \\nCitizens from his community drank from the Cup. He held a toast for everyone who had shown up at a local bar, raising his Bud Light with a wide smile on his face. He stopped by the town’s water tower, emblazoned with two hockey sticks and considered something of a monument. He reminisced with his old friend Gigi Marvin, a gold-medalist with the U.S. Olympic women’s hockey team and who, along with Oshie, had been named royalty at the 2005 Warroad Frosty Festival, when both were still in high school. He sat down at one point to eat Cap’n Crunch out of the Cup. \\nHe planned to take the Cup to Minneapolis later in the day to share with teammates Shane Gersich and Travis Boyd, but before he returned to the small airport, he posed for countless more photos. That included one with the town’s mayor, who officially and proudly declared Tuesday, July 24, as “T.J.

Matt Niskanen had learned to play hockey at this facility, first in pee-wee and then in high school, so it only made sense that this would be the first stop for the Washington Capitals defenseman on his day with the Cup. \\nNiskanen wore a gray shirt with black shorts and black hat, almost blending in as he shook hands with countless citizens from the community. He had already shown an ability to relate to his fans during the Stanley Cup run during the spring, when he rode Washington’s Metro to Game 3 along with teammate and fellow Minnesota native T.J. Oshie; that only endeared him more with a fan-base that already recognized how valuable he was on the ice. \\nNiskanen was not only a centerpiece of Washington’s markedly improved defense during the postseason – but he also embodied the Capitals’ willingness to outwork teams down the stretch. One of his signature moments came at the end of the second period in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals against Vegas, when he outhustled the Golden Knights and created a short-handed breakaway. He was tripped by Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury on his way to the net, earning a penalty and providing a momentum-altering sequence in his team’s 3-1 win. His teammate, Jay Beagle, would later call him “our rock back there.” \\nWashington wouldn’t lose another game in the series, in large part because Niskanen – who also produced one goal and eight assists during the playoffs -- helped galvanize a roster that checked and blocked shots at every turn. It only made sense that he was gifted with the key to his hometown on Sunday.\\nAfter he was done posing for photos and taking the Cup to the middle of the arena at Miners Memorial Building, he eventually returned home and watched his young son, Charlie, use it as a bowl for some fruit snacks. \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter a decade of chasing the Stanley Cup – he had lost both in the Western Conference Finals with the Dallas Stars during his rookie year in 2008 and in the Eastern Conference Finals with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2013 before enduring several years of postseason heartbreak with the Capitals – Niskanen spent one of his final moments with the cup on the banks of Lake Vermillion, lifting the trophy over his head as the sun set, finally a champion. — Roman Stubbs\\n\\nRead more\\nBack to top\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (Washington Capitals)\\n\\nJakub Vrana\\nDay 10 | Prague, Czech Republic\\nThe night that ended with the Washington Capitals lifting the Stanley Cup began with a goal from Jakub Vrana. The speedy Czech winger skated down the left-center of the ice on a breakaway, then sniped a wrist shot over the glove of Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury. The goal put Washington ahead 1-0, a just reward for a player who had created numerous scoring chances throughout the Stanley Cup finals.\\nThat moment, and that night, triggered a chain reaction that helped introduce the Prague native to fans in his new home of Washington. On the Capitals’ first weekend back with the Cup, Vrana’s Instagram story helped detail much of the beer-drenched celebration – and provided a look at his new Stanley Cup tattoo. He further \\nendeared himself to fans\\n during the parade by shotgunning a beer from the top of a tour bus and professing his love for the fanbase during an impromptu radio interview conducted on a phone flung into that bus.\\nVrana both toned down and classed up his drinking when he reclaimed the Cup in his home city, most notably when he sprayed champagne into a crowd and eventually his mouth at a rally near the ice rink where he learned the game.\\nEarlier in the day he hosted a private gathering with friends and family at a favorite restaurant, the Cup sitting on a table surrounded by wide-bodied Bohemian beer mugs and trays of food. From there, Vrana and his mother brought the trophy to the cemetery in which his grandmother was laid to rest.\\nHe also squeezed in a trip to the hockey shooting range – a large rectangle of netting with a goal-sized yellow frame – where he refined his shot outside his apartment. It was that shot that gave the Capitals an early lead in the decisive game of the Stanley Cup finals.\\nVrana capped his time with the trophy at a Prague night club before it was shipped back to North America to continue its tour.

He carried it into the backyard, where his family and friends awaited with their phone cameras at the ready, eager to capture a moment that seemed inconceivable just five months ago.\\nKempny started the season with the Chicago Blackhawks, and by February, he was often out of the lineup for a team that was going to miss the playoffs. The 27-year-old was in just his second NHL season, and his career in the league was on life support. He was already considering returning to Europe and to play. \\nBut then he was traded to the Capitals in exchange for a third-round pick before the Feb. 26 trade deadline, and his smooth skating helped solidify what had been a porous Washington defense. En route to the franchise’s first Stanley Cup championship, Kempny scored two goals with three assists while skating more than 17 minutes per game. After his future in the NHL was in doubt earlier this year, Kempny signed a four-year, $10 million extension with the Capitals.\\nIn his backyard in Hodonin, a barrel served as the pedestal for the Stanley Cup, a small dog placed inside the bowl for photos. The next morning, he buckled the trophy into the passenger seat of his Ford Mustang convertible before arriving at his childhood rink. A drum line introduced him as he walked through the crowd, stopping so people could rub their hands on the names engraved in silver. His isn’t on there yet, but Washington’s roster will spend 65 years on the trophy.\\n\\n \\n\\nKempny’s next stop with the Stanley Cup was Brno, roughly an hour away from Hodonin. The drum line greeted him there, too, and highlights from Kempny’s career flashed across the videoboard. Kempny played in Brno for six seasons, from 18 to 24 years old.

They yelled their congratulations. “Great job, Sanya!” some shouted, calling him by his Russian nickname. \\n“Alex Ovechkin is in Red Square with the Stanley Cup,” one woman frantically whispered into her cellphone as she tried to keep up with his brisk strides.\\nWith St. Basil’s Cathedral in the background, Ovechkin stopped, and his agent and a Washington Capitals spokesman attempted to keep the crowd back. Ovechkin asked the people posted behind him to clear a path so that the cathedral could be visible.\\n\\n\\n\\nOvechkin promised his former youth coach last summer that he’d return with the Stanley Cup and they’d drink beer.  (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\\n\\n“Can I please get a picture?” he asked of what had become a mob.\\nThe crowd obliged, parting to create a clearing. He then hoisted the Stanley Cup above his head to the sound of cheers. Phones followed the Cup up to get the shot of Ovechkin finally returning home with the prize so many expected he would claim one day. \\nIt has been a month since the Capitals won their first Stanley Cup championship, and in a weekend 13 years in the making, Ovechkin was awarded two days with the Stanley Cup in his hometown, a tradition for the winning team’s captain. For one of Moscow’s most beloved sons, it represented a prophecy fulfilled.\\n“I wanted to be the guy who brings the Cup,” said Ovechkin, who had promised as much as recently as last summer.\\nOvechkin returned Saturday to the Dynamo hockey club facility where he played as a teenager and where there’s a large photo of him in the main lobby that he signed, “Thanks for everything.” When Ovechkin was 14, Hall of Famer Igor Larionov, who won three Stanley Cups with the Detroit Red Wings, visited Dynamo and spoke of his career and his championships.\\nAs Ovechkin walked around his old locker room a year ago, he told Dynamo Coach Vladimir Vorobiev that he would be back with the Stanley Cup and they would drink beer together. On Saturday, Ovechkin had the Stanley Cup to his left with a tray of food on his right as his van pulled up to the training center, an arch with light blue and white balloons and a pedestal for the trophy awaiting his arrival at the front of the building. He went through the back entrance for a few quiet moments. This was where he ran laps after every practice and “hated it,” Ovechkin said, still able to picture his father sitting on the bench watching him. \\n\\n\\n\\nAlex Ovechkin kisses his father, Mikhail. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\\n\\nHis father, Mikhail, was present Saturday as well, mingling outside and posing for photos with some of the large crowd that had gathered to see Ovechkin bring the trophy home. Ovechkin grabbed the 35-pound cup and waited by the door, lifting it for Mikhail to touch as he walked in.\\nThey then hoisted it together.\\n“Kiss it,” Ovechkin told him. \\n“We waited 13 years,” Mikhail said after planting a smooch on the silver.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe night Ovechkin and the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas, Mikhail had been watching the game at the family’s country home in the Moscow suburbs. With the NHL app on his phone, he watches his son’s every game — and later the highlights — from the dining room television. Ovechkin typically calls his parents before every game, but despite the late hour in Moscow, he called Mikhail after Washington’s championship-clinching Game 5 win against Vegas. He told his father he loved him and he was thankful for everything he did to help him reach that point.\\n“It was something he was dreaming about,” Alex said. “That’s why he give so much help, so much of his time to me and it’s all about that.”\\n“I can’t even put it into words,” Mikhail said. “Thirteen years we were working toward that goal, and finally to win the Stanley Cup, it’s a huge happiness. Huge happiness.”\\nThe younger Ovechkin later carried the trophy up the stairs, where Dynamo has its museum. The signed jerseys and sticks of notable former players are in glass cases, and Ovechkin immediately picked out Capitals teammate Nicklas Backstrom’s display from when they played there together during the 2012-13 NHL lockout. \\nWith the Stanley Cup still in his grasp, he turned in place as his eyes scanned the room, perhaps considering that a photo of him visiting with the Stanley Cup soon would be proudly displayed. After he told a group of kids in Dynamo jerseys to follow their dreams and then posed for photos with the Stanley Cup, Ovechkin laced up skates and carried the trophy onto the rink where he once practiced, hoisting it up as someone on the bench warned him not to fall because the blades were dull. He then returned to the locker room, set the Stanley Cup down and clinked frosted mugs with Vorobiev.\\n“You know, Alex is a big star,’ Vorobiev said. “When he’s young, every guy who play with him, is working with him, he know he’s going to be a big star.”\\nThe Stanley Cup made its first voyage to Russia in 1997, the summer that Detroit won with five Russians, and Pittsburgh Penguins center Evgeni Malkin brought the trophy to Moscow the past two summers. But perhaps no player had higher hopes placed on him than Ovechkin, the first overall pick in 2004 who became one of the greatest goal scorers in NHL history. He first saw the trophy when he visited Toronto’s Hockey Hall of Fame as a Capitals rookie. Apparently unconcerned with superstition, he touched it.\\n“I knew one day we would win it,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlex Ovechkin posed with more than 3,000 fans at the World Cup Fan Fest as he toured his hometown with the Stanley Cup. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\\n\\nIt was after 1 p.m. on Saturday when the Stanley Cup finally made it through customs and Moscow traffic and into Ovechkin’s hands again. He set it on a table as he passed through a metal detector for a gathering of fans at the Moscow State University campus, there for a viewing party of Russia’s World Cup quarterfinal soccer game against Croatia. As he lifted it above his head for the crowd, one man yelled to him, “We’ve been waiting for you our entire lives.”\\nOvechkin posed for more than 3,000 photos as part of an event organized by the Putin Team, a social media movement Ovechkin started in November to support Russian President Vladi\\xadmir Putin. He shook so many hands that he later asked for a wet napkin. The night finished with a private party at a ritzy karaoke club with a guest list that included famous Russian actors, musicians, Capitals teammates Evgeny Kuznetsov and Dmitry Orlov and former Washington center Sergei Fedorov. \\nAs Ovechkin waited to make his grand entrance and carry the Stanley Cup into the ballroom, the master of ceremonies introduced him: “This is a moment to remember. He’s been waiting for this Cup for a long, long time.”\\nAfter a hectic and public first day with the trophy, Ovechkin chose to make Sunday more private. He took the Stanley Cup to a closed hockey game with high-ranking government officials, including Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev — but not Putin. He visited his family’s childhood apartment, laying with the trophy on the twin bed he used to sleep in. Then he and his parents went to the cemetery where his older brother, Sergey, rests after he died of a blood clot after a car accident when Ovechkin was 10. The Stanley Cup minders stayed in the car as Ovechkin carried the trophy to the headstone.\\n“It’s hard,” Ovechkin said. “But I think it was very important for me personally because he’s my brother obviously. He’s motivated me to play hard and give what I can on the ice.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOvechkin arrives with the Stanley Cup at the Royal Arbat club.

Slava Fetisov and Larionov took photos there when they brought the trophy to Moscow as part of the Red Wings’ Russian Five with Fedorov, but Ovechkin was quick to point out that his moment was different — “I’m pretty sure there was not lots of people around them,” he said.\\nThey had been waiting for that iconic shot as long as he had.\\n“I don’t know if it was me or Stanley Cup,” Ovechkin said. “But both of us give all attention to this situation. It’s special moment. It’s nice to see when the people understand what you want to do. They take a step back, and we take what I think was a good picture.

Queen’s “We Are The Champions” played as it made its entrance, and an atrium full of kids so sick they had to spend the Fourth of July at the hospital stood and cheered, phones up to capture photos of the hulking silver trophy and the man lugging it around for the day.\\nWashington Capitals defenseman John Carlson was the first player to get the Stanley Cup all to himself for 15 hours this summer, free to spend that time however he wished. He wanted it to stay in Washington, choosing to whisk the chalice from the Bethesda Firehouse to Children’s National Medical Center to a fundraiser in Bethesda before ending the night with a private party at Salt Line in Navy Yard.\\nIt was all very fitting for the 28-year-old who was drafted by the Capitals a decade ago. He has since met his wife Gina in Washington, started a family here and settled here, the only player who continues to live and train here for the duration of the offseason. He had already endeared himself to the area with a career year — 15 goals and 53 assists to lead all NHL defensemen in scoring during the regular season and five goals with 20 assists in the playoffs — but nine days after Carlson signed an eight-year, $64 million extension with the team, he further cemented himself as a true Washingtonian.\\n“I think everyone around and my family is going to celebrate it the same no matter where I was, but it’s nice to be able to enjoy it with the fans as well and to do pretty special stuff like this,” Carlson said.\\nThe Carlsons’s pediatrician is on the board at Children’s National, so they’ve felt a connection there and offered to bring by the Stanley Cup just 10 days earlier. Kids and hospital employees lined up to take photos with Carlson and the trophy, and for the ones who were too sick to get to the atrium, Carlson visited their rooms. One father offered congratulations to Carlson on his contract. Then he looked at the Stanley Cup sitting on a table.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn Carlson, right, wheels the Stanley Cup in through Children's National. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\\n\\n“Can I touch it?” he asked Carlson.\\n“Yeah,” Carlson replied with a smile.\\n“The place exploded when it came into the room because it means so much,” said Kurt Newman, the chief executive and president of Children’s National. “It means championships, it means winning and it kind of, in some ways, is symbolic about what a kid is facing maybe with a tumor or maybe it’s a premature infant and those families. If the Caps can do it, if anybody can do it, we can, too. It just really has that kind of lift and appeal. Yeah, it’s hockey and it’s sports, but when you think about how that team came together and the city’s come together, Children’s National is proud to be part of it.”\\nCarlson was born in Massachusetts and played his youth hockey in New Jersey, but after his visit to the hospital, Carlson took the Stanley Cup to his Chevy Chase neighborhood, walking down the street to a yard where a small crowd had gathered to touch it and take photos with it. A five-minute drive away, a fundraising party had already started in downtown Bethesda to benefit the Michael Mosier Defeat DIPG Foundation, which raises awareness and provides research funding to treat aggressive brain tumors that targets children. Standard tickets were $20 each, and a line snaked under a tent to take photos with Carlson before he even arrived. The event ultimately raised more than $100,000 for Carlson’s cause.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn Carlson shows off the Stanley Cup to his neighbors in Chevy Chase, Md. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\\n\\nGrant Paulsen, co-host of 106.7 The Fan’s midday “Grant and Danny Show” and master of ceremonies for the fundraiser, introduced Carlson with a chant of “Eight More Years.”\\n“I love this place,” Carlson said to the crowd.\\n“We love you, too,” someone yelled back.\\n“It’s about the fans, too,” Carlson said later. “They get joy seeing the Cup and seeing me and all that, and that’s awesome, too. It’s just a good mix of both and doing the right thing and doing a fun thing. We’re all enjoying ourselves and raising a lot of money, so that’s kind of the best of both worlds.”\\nThe Stanley Cup got a respite from the heat at Carlson’s home, posted next to his sleeping son Rudy — appropriately born during the postseason — before a final stop on Washington’s Southeast Waterfront. Patrons surrounded the outdoor bar at Salt Line when a bus pulled up and the crowd that was inside for a private party emptied out of the restaurant with their phones raised for photos. Carlson carried the Stanley Cup out of the bus as a man and his girlfriend happened to be walking by, abruptly stopping and pointing when the silver caught their eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarlson put the trophy on a table in the backroom, allowing his friends and family to take photos with it throughout the evening. One father lifted his son over the bowl at the top, allowing him to peer at the engravings and see his own reflection.

(Patrick Smith/Getty Images)   by Isabelle Khurshudyan July 19 Email the author   The Washington Capitals re-signed defenseman Madison Bowey to a two-year, $2 million deal, the team announced Thursday. Bowey was a restricted free agent, and the extension leaves the Capitals with just one player left to sign: right wing Tom Wilson. After Washington drafted Bowey in the second round in 2013, he made his NHL debut this past season, appearing in 51 games with an average ice time of 13:43. Although the 23-year-old didn’t appear in any playoff games, he’s expected to be on the NHL roster again next season, and that it’s a one-way contract for both years of his new deal supports that. The Capitals now have six defensemen under contract, and General Manager Brian MacLellan said adding a veteran blue-liner was a consideration, especially with Bowey and Christian Djoos entering just their sophomore campaigns. MacLellan confirmed Washington was in discussions with veteran Brooks Orpik, whom the team traded to Colorado at the draft in a salary cap-clearing move. The Avalanche bought out the last year of Orpik’s deal, making him an unrestricted free agent. The 37-year-old remains unsigned. “We’re still in discussions with maybe one or two free agents,” MacLellan said July 3. “There’s a trade-off: We think Madison can take the step to the next level, and same with Djoos. They both played well this year, and I think they’re going to improve as we go this year.” Bowey’s contract leaves the Capitals with roughly $7.2 million in cap space, and they have 21 players under contract. Wilson, a restricted free agent, did not elect for arbitration, so it’s unclear how long his contract negotiations might take. His agent, Mark Guy, said this week that, while there has been regular dialogue with Washington, a new deal isn’t “done or close.” The sides are exploring an extension potentially “north of four years,” which could mean an average annual value in the neighborhood of $4 million. Assuming Wilson’s deal gets done, the Capitals, who won the franchise’s first Stanley Cup last month, would be in line to return six of their defensemen from last season as well as their entire top-nine forward corps.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Mike Hume July 24 Email the author   The Washington Capitals announced Tuesday that free agent defenseman Brooks Orpik will return to the team on a one-year contract that carries a salary cap hit of $1 million. The move ensures the Capitals will return all six defensemen who played for them in the Stanley Cup finals as they claimed the franchise’s first championship, a group that also includes Michal Kempny and John Carlson, each of whom re-signed earlier this offseason. The Capitals had traded Orpik to the Colorado Avalanche, along with goaltender Philipp Grubauer, at the NHL draft to clear Orpik’s $5.5 million salary cap hit from their books, in part to find money to keep Kempny and Carlson. The Avalanche elected to buy out the 37-year-old’s deal, making him a free agent. [The Stanley Cup tracker: Where will the Caps take it next?] “Brooks has been a valuable player and a great mentor for our young players, and we are thrilled to bring him back to our organization,” Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan said. “We feel his leadership and competitiveness on and off the ice will be welcomed back to our group.” Orpik drew criticism as his contract neared its final season, largely because of his lack of speed in a league that increasingly prioritizes the trait. That criticism was amplified given a salary cap hit that made him Washington’s seventh-highest-paid player in terms of annual average value last season. The Capitals’ players, coaches and executives all lauded Orpik’s leadership and attitude, citing it as a key factor in their recent success. The one-year term and $1 million price tag — which could include another $500,000 in performance bonuses — is a far more team-friendly deal, and Orpik again will provide leadership for a roster that figures to incorporate more young players in the coming season. His presence also will make it tougher for some of the team’s defensive prospects — such as Madison Bowey, recently re-signed on a two-year deal, and 2016 first-round draft pick Lucas Johansen — to crack Washington’s lineup. The team has been successful in keeping most of its championship roster in place, save Grubauer and fourth-line center Jay Beagle, who signed with the Vancouver Canucks.\\xa0After the Orpik signing, the Capitals have roughly $7 million in salary cap space to work with as they attempt to finalize a new contract with winger Tom Wilson, a restricted free agent.

Mitch Korn, Washington’s director of goaltending, will take on the same position in New York, the Islanders announced Thursday. Korn had instructed goaltenders for Trotz since 1998 with the Nashville Predators. When Trotz moved on from Washington after a contract dispute, most observers assumed Korn’s days in the District were also numbered. Korn spent four years with the Capitals, the first three as goaltending coach. Last season, Korn promoted deputy Scott Murray and took the title of director of goaltending, signifying a more hands-off and developmental approach to netminding throughout the Capitals’ system. Korn coached all-time great Dominik Hasek to four Vezina Trophies as the NHL’s top goaltender in the 1990s before he helped Capitals starter Braden Holtby win the award two seasons ago.

In a deal long expected, Washington will pay Wilson $31 million over six seasons, an average of $5.17 million, according to a press release the team sent Friday night. “Tom is an invaluable member of our team, and we are pleased that he will play a great part in our foreseeable future,” General Manager Brian MacLellan said in the statement. “Tom is a unique player in this league. At 24 years of age, he has an impressive amount of experience, and we believe that he will only continue to grow and improve as a player. With his ability to play in virtually any game situation, teams need players like Tom in order to succeed in the NHL.” [Tom Wilson and the Capitals will reach a deal. The questions: When, and for how much?] Wilson’s 14 goals, 21 assists and 15:59 average ice time during the regular season were career highs.\\xa0The 6-foot-4, 218-pounder scored five goals and added 10 assists during the postseason, though his most memorable moment might have been his hit on the Penguins’ Zach Aston-Reese in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. The league suspended Wilson for three games, but he returned the following series and continued his hard-hitting play. It was one of three suspensions for him last season. Wilson, who earned $2.25 million last season, was a restricted free agent, meaning the Capitals owned his negotiating rights. He opted not to file for arbitration. Without arbitration, it was possible negotiations could have lasted until training camp. “6 more years in DC!! Love this team and love this city. Beyond excited to stay a part of the Capitals family!” Wilson tweeted. After re-signing defenseman Madison Bowey to a two-year, $2 million deal last week and Brooks Orpik to a one-year $1 million contract Tuesday, Washington had roughly $6.2 million in cap space for the upcoming season. Several industry insiders projected the team would have to pay Wilson between $3.5 million and $4.5 million per year. In that sense, the player might have won this negotiation, but the Caps are locking up a 24-year-old who was their first-round pick in 2012 and has consistently improved. This past season, he spent the majority of his minutes on the top line with captain Alex Ovechkin and also was one of the team’s top penalty-killers. He is perhaps the Capitals’ most physical player, with a well-deserved reputation as the team’s enforcer. According to the website dropyourgloves.com, Wilson engaged in 18 fights in 2017-18 — including one in the playoffs — and won 13 of the exchanges. ',\n",

The Ted Leonsis-run pro sports enterprise announced a 10-year agreement Monday that gives MedStar Health naming rights for three Washington-area practice facilities: the Capitals’ training rinks in Arlington, formerly called Kettler Capitals Iceplex; the new basketball training facility in Southeast Washington that will house the Wizards, the Mystics and the Capital City Go-Go, the city’s new G League team; and the training space used by Wizards District Gaming, the esports team that competes in the NBA 2K League and practices in a facility adjacent to Capital One Arena. “We are thrilled to enter into this innovative partnership with them that will bring MedStar’s unparalleled excellence in health care to every single team in the Monumental Sports family,” Leonsis said in a statement. “We hope that this expanded partnership will help reimagine the way teams in professional sports approach delivering the very best medical care.” The deal was formally announced at a news conference Monday morning in Arlington. Financial terms were not disclosed. Under the naming rights deal, the esports training facility in Chinatown will become the MedStar Wizards District Gaming Studio. The Capitals’ Arlington facility, which has become a popular destination for fans to watch practices and morning skates, will become MedStar Capitals Iceplex. (That facility had been known as Kettler Capitals Iceplex since it opened in the fall of 2006.) And the practice facility at Washington’s new basketball arena, the $65 million project in Ward 8 on the former St. Elizabeths hospital grounds, will be named MedStar Wizards Performance Center. It is expected to open this fall; the arena itself does not yet have a naming rights deal. “We are also very proud to have MedStar join us in bringing their powerful brand to southeast Washington,” Leonsis said. “We are focused on making the MedStar Wizards Performance Center a vibrant part of the community in Anacostia, and we are thrilled to have MedStar partner with us in this effort.” [He quit his State Department job to play video games. Now he’s a star in the NBA’s 2K League.] MedStar Health already provided health-care services and sponsored training camp and practice-jersey patches for the Wizards and Capitals. The new deal encompasses all of the Monumental teams, including its two Arena Football League franchises, and aims to create a novel health-care model, according to Monumental officials. MedStar will establish a council of medical professionals who provide services to the teams. That council will assess, discuss and administer best practices and training techniques for each squad. A single medical director will be appointed to oversee the entire operation.\\xa0The council will meet monthly, alongside trainers, coaches and team executives, to exchange ideas and best practices and to discuss what they’re seeing on each roster and in each discipline. “We think we can get a competitive advantage in treating every sport and every player so they can get to their top-top performance parameters,” Leonsis said at Monday’s news conference. “That’s why this partnership is just so meaningful for us.” Jim Van Stone, Monumental’s president of business operations, said the arrangement is potentially “game-changing,” allowing constant discussion and ensuring that each team will be keep abreast of the most advanced sports medicine regimens, sports training techniques and new technologies. “Having one partner across all properties really allows you to open up the dialogue and the communication on what’s really the most cutting-edge techniques and preparing athletes for peak performance,” he said. “I think the integration of the medical council allows, really, that open dialogue among the teams. Each of the sports we have here at Monumental is just completely different.” MedStar is not the only medical provider to enter into a high-profile agreement with a Washington professional sports team. In 2016, the Redskins renamed their Ashburn headquarters the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park, and the team’s Richmond training camp is sponsored by Bon Secours Health System. But Monumental’s varied holdings could make its new deal more noteworthy. “The collaboration of all these different training teams and medical teams really working together, I think, is really going to put us in a fantastic position,” Van Stone said. “I don’t think there’s another opportunity out there that brings all these different facets under one umbrella.” More sports coverage from The Post: Capitals re-sign forward Tom Wilson to six-year deal Dwight Howard has been the star of the show. With the Wizards, he’ll be part of the chorus. Is D.J. Swearinger the leader of the Redskins’ defense? ‘No question,’ says the safety. ',\n",

(Patrick Smith/Getty Images)   by Dan Steinberg July 30 Email the author   The resurfacing of old tweets containing offensive language has, in recent months, created ripples in college basketball (Donte DiVincenzo) and the NFL (Josh Allen), to say nothing of the entertainment and political realms. Major League Baseball now is in the spotlight, with successive news stories on years-old tweets sent by Brewers reliever Josh Hader, Braves pitcher Sean Newcomb and Nationals infielder Trea Turner. Those stories have prompted many, both inside and outside pro sports, to wonder why professional athletes don’t delete their entire Twitter histories when they become famous, eliminating any potentially offensive messages from the Internet. “If you’re on Twitter, please spend the five minutes it takes to scrub your account of anything you wouldn’t want plastered next to your face on the front page of a newspaper,” Cubs pitcher Jon Lester tweeted on Monday. “Better yet, don’t say stupid things in the first place. Too many young guys getting burned. …\\xa0Listen I’m far from the sharpest tool in the shed and there’s certainly no halo above my head (pardon the rhyme) but I know some of these guys are great dudes who just had lapses in judgment.” Lester clarified in subsequent tweets that he was not excusing any of the tweets in question, nor was he defending their authors. But his thought was a natural one, and a close cousin to another question being asked this week: With all they have to lose, why would professional athletes be on social media to begin with? [Svrluga: When an athlete’s ugly tweets hit home, ‘it feels like an actual gut-punch’] An answer to that particular question came Monday evening from Nats closer Sean Doolittle, in a lengthy and much-lauded string of messages. Doolittle’s basic thesis: Baseball needs to concern itself with the message, not the medium, and the message hasn’t always been good enough. “It’s been a tough couple of weeks for baseball on twitter,” Doolittle wrote. “It sucks to see racist and homophobic language coming from inside our league — a league I’m so proud to be a part of that I’ve worked really hard to make a more accepting and inclusive place for all our fans to enjoy.   It’s been a tough couple of weeks for baseball on twitter. It sucks to see racist and homophobic language coming from inside our league - a league I’m so proud to be a part of that I’ve worked really hard to make a more accepting and inclusive place for all our fans to enjoy.— Sean Doolittle (@whatwouldDOOdo) July 30, 2018    “We have to start caring as much about the content of the posts as we do about when they were made and how they came to light,” he continued. “The answer isn’t for athletes to leave social media. Social media can be great for an athlete. I met my wife on twitter (long story). It helps athletes share their stories and personalities and connect with their community. Besides, it’s not like you can accidentally post a slur.” A brief aside: Doolittle wasn’t joking about meeting his wife on Twitter. He and Eireann Dolan retold the story of their online romance to The Washington Post’s Chelsea Janes this spring:  Fittingly, Doolittle and Dolan met on Twitter, a story they recalled fondly last week on the patio behind the Nationals’ complex. Dolan was friends with Doolittle’s teammate Brandon McCarthy. Doolittle would reply to their tweets now and then, not thinking much of it. After weeks of public replies, Dolan sent him a puzzling message — “Why are you funny?” “I was mad he was funny, because I don’t like when people are good at two different things,” Dolan said. “You should be good at baseball or you should be good at being funny online. He was both, and I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t care for this at all. You need to pick a side.’” Because he wouldn’t pick just baseball, they ended up on the same side in the end.  (If you’ll tolerate another brief aside, turns out your humble author also met his wife on Twitter. Thanks to a shared interest in, of all things, the Washington Wizards. And now we have a chubby little toddler girl with a dresser full of D.C. sports gear. So don’t say the Wizards, and Twitter, haven’t created any happiness in this crazy, mixed-up world.) Anyhow, back to Doolittle. “A lot of the tweets that have surfaced are from several years ago — from a time in their lives when they may not have realized the impact those words have,” he wrote. “But as you learn from and grow out of that youthful [indiscretion], delete those posts to reflect that growth.\\xa0Between all the people you meet and the places you go, there is a lot of opportunity for personal growth in baseball. It’s entirely possible that those old posts no longer reflect that person’s views. But actions will speak louder than words. “It’s a reminder that words matter, and that the impact the of words matter more than the intent. Rather than feeling like this platform makes us targets and we have to censor ourselves, find a way to use the platform to lift others up and make a positive impact.\\xa0It can be tough for athletes to understand why these words are so hurtful. Most of us have been at the top of the food chain since [high school], immune to insults. When all you’ve known is success and triumph it can be difficult to empathize with feeling vulnerable or marginalized. [Nationals’ Trea Turner is the latest MLB player to have ugly tweets uncovered] “Homophobic slurs are still used to make people feel soft or weak or otherwise inferior — which is [BS],” Doolittle wrote. “Some of the strongest people I know are from the LGBTQIA community. It takes courage to be your true self when your identity has been used as an insult or a pejorative.” (Another aside: Doolittle and Dolan have long been outspoken supporters of MLB pride nights, donating hundreds of tickets to the Oakland A’s pride night to\\xa0LGBT youth groups, recording a promo for this year’s Nats night\\xa0and visiting\\xa0SMYAL, a support and mentoring group for D.C.-area LGBTQ youth. Witness also the T-shirt Doolittle wore on his way into Nationals Park during the All-Star Game festivities.)

I hope we can learn from this and make the MLB a place where all our fans feel welcome.” While some fans and media members have found the recent apologies lacking, Doolittle earned enthusiastic praise for his remarks, which were widely shared on Monday.   sean doolittle is a great human— Janiece 🦄 (@feelingamazing) July 30, 2018      This is the thread I need from a major league ballplayer.

We’re going to start on page 420 of the Mets’ media guide, the postseason section. The first page of the postseason section is the 1969 League Championship Series, Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets.” For the next six minutes, Cohen and his broadcast partners, Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez, stopped calling the ugly action on the field and read directly from the media guide. It was a history lesson from happier times for the Mets, and it was brilliant.    (Via MLB.tv)  “In the club’s first-ever trip to the postseason, the Mets swept the best-of-five series versus Atlanta, three games to none,” Cohen began as the theme from “Masterpiece Theatre” played in the background. “In Game 1, trailing 5-4 in the top of the eighth, New York rallied for five runs and a 9-5 win. Tom Seaver struggled, allowed five runs in seven innings, but earned the victory. In Game 2, two-run home runs by Tommie Agee, Ken Boswell and Cleon Jones lifted the Mets to an 11-6 win. In front of 54,195 fans at Shea — I might add, parenthetically, I was one of them — New York advanced to the World Series with a 7-4 victory in Game 3. The lead changed hands three times before Wayne Garrett’s two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth put the Mets ahead 5-4. Nolan Ryan hurled seven innings in relief to pick up the win and complete the sweep. Boswell hit .333 with two home runs and five RBI, while Agee batted .357 with two home runs and four RBI. Hank Aaron cracked a home run in each game and drove in seven runs for the Braves. We’re going to move to page 422.” “Is it my turn to read?” Darling asked as the music continued to play and the booth continued to ignore whatever was happening on the field. “Page 422, if you have it at home, folks. This is the 1969 World Series, the Baltimore Orioles versus the Mets. The Mets, of course, won the series, 4-1. The New York Mets entered the 1969 World Series as heavy underdogs against Baltimore. After failing in Game 1, The Amazins rattled off four straight wins to earn their first championship just eight years after the franchise was born.” “It’s like a Seder,” Cohen said before Darling eventually passed the book to Hernandez. “A raucous Shea crowd of 56,335 watched the Mets shut out Baltimore, 5-0, in Game 3,” Hernandez said. “Tommie Agee hit a leadoff home run off Jim Palmer, the only leadoff home run the Hall of Famer would ever allow, to put the Mets on the board early.” [After a stress-packed deadline day, Nats hammer Mets in a laugher] Cohen wrapped up the impromptu story time by reading the guide’s account of the Mets’ World Series-clinching win on Oct. 16, 1969. By this point, there was one out in the inning and a runner on first. “Behind a 5-3 victory, New York’s lovable losers were champions,” he said. “The Orioles led 3-0 early, but home runs by [Donn] Clendenon and [Al] Weis tied the game.

With the Mets trailing, 19-1, and not interested in burning any more relievers, Manager Mickey Callaway tapped shortstop Jose Reyes to make his pitching debut. The 35-year-old Reyes didn’t fare well, but he managed to provide a few laughs, including after he wound up to throw his first pitch before Zimmerman had even stepped into the batter’s box.

The Nationals’ first baseman grinned as he returned to the dugout. Reyes smiled, too, for his ERA was a sparkling 0.00. That wouldn’t last. The Nationals tagged Reyes for six runs on five hits in the inning and batted around, giving Zimmerman another chance with two outs and Wilmer Difo on third base following an RBI triple.    (Via MLB.tv)  As Reyes’s teammates giggled from the top step of the dugout, Zimmerman swung through a couple of curveballs in his second plate appearance against the veteran shortstop. After Zimmerman fouled off another slow offering, Reyes “plunked” Zimmerman’s left leg with a 54 mph curveball that didn’t curve and probably didn’t leave a mark. Zimmerman stood frozen for a moment, looked up, wiggled his butt and then faked as if he were about to charge the mound before flashing a huge smile and walking to first base.

(Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)   by Matt Bonesteel July 31 Email the author   As hard as it might be to imagine, Alex Trebek cannot go on hosting “Jeopardy!” forever. He turned 78 on July 22 and has had a number of health scares over the years, including brain surgery to remove blood clots in December, and with his contract expiring in 2020 he is thinking of retirement. In a chat\\xa0Sunday with Harvey Levin on Fox News Channel’s “OBJECTified,” he said his chances of staying at the podium past that date are “50/50 and a little less.” But like “The Price Is Right” after Bob Barker handed off his skinny microphone to Drew Carey, “Jeopardy!” seems almost certain to continue after Trebek’s departure. It averages nearly 10 million viewers per week, making it one of the most-watched shows on television and a massive profit generator for Sony Pictures Television. So eventually “Jeopardy!” will need a new host, and Trebek has just the guy in mind. But unless you’re an ardent fan of the Los Angeles Kings, you have probably never heard of him. “I mentioned to our producer not so long ago that the fellow who does play-by-play for the Los Angeles Kings, they should consider him,” Trebek told Levin. That fellow is Alex Faust, who recently completed his first season calling Kings games on TV for Fox Sports West after replacing the legendary Bob Miller. He’s 28 years old and seems pretty thrilled to receive the Trebek seal of approval.   I guess there are worse ways to randomly see your name show up on TMZ! 🤷🏻\\u200d♂️I’m flattered by Mr. Trebek’s kind words, and delighted to hear he’s a big @LAKings fan! 👑— Alex Faust (@alex_faust) July 30, 2018    Faust was plucked from relative obscurity to replace Miller, who had called Kings games for nearly the entirety of the franchise’s existence. The Brooklyn-born Faust had spent the early portion of his career working\\xa0college football, basketball and lacrosse games for ESPNU along with a smattering of minor league hockey and some work on NBC Sports Network’s NHL coverage. It was a big leap from all that to the Kings, and it would be a colossal ascent from there to “Jeopardy!”      Trebek told Levin he did have one other person in mind as a possible replacement:\\xa0CNN legal analyst and SiriusXM radio host Laura Coates, who said on Twitter that she watches “Jeopardy!” every day.

(Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press via AP)   by Matt Bonesteel August 1 at 6:51 AM Email the author   Johnny Manziel will take a major step in his attempt at career revitalization Friday night, when he will start for the Montreal Alouettes at home against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. It will be his first appearance in a professional football game since December 2015, when he took his final snaps for the Cleveland Browns before the NFL franchise cut him months later after numerous off-field incidents.   🚨Confirmed!🚨Johnny Manziel will be the starting quarterback this Friday, August 3 against the @Ticats. #AlsMTL #ToujoursGame #JohnnyFootball #Number2 pic.twitter.com/Soy42t6IGx— #AlsMTL (@MTLAlouettes) July 31, 2018    “It’s good to be back in here,” Manziel told reporters Tuesday. “I felt like the thing I’ve been missing, even over the course of this year and a couple years, is reps. And as you guys have seen the last couple days, a chance to get with the 1s and get some reps is what I feel like I really need and what I’ve talked to a lot of people about. “So I feel very blessed to be in this position, to be back in a situation where I’m starting again. It’s good. It’s a quick turnaround. But at the same time, I’m excited for the opportunity.” The Alouettes acquired Manziel from the Tiger-Cats in a trade on July 22. Hamilton had signed the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner to a two-year contract in May but traded him after incumbent quarterback Jeremiah Masoli got off to a strong start to the CFL season. It quickly became apparent that Montreal Coach Mike Sherman intended to get Manziel onto the field as quickly as possible, with his team struggling to a 1-5 start. “We didn’t trade for Johnny to have him sit on the bench. Obviously he’s come here to get reps; to become the best player he can become. We started that process today,” Sherman said Monday, per the Montreal Gazette, about whether Manziel would replace incumbent starter Vernon Adams Jr. “You’ve all probably figured it out yourselves. At the same time, when you have two players [fairly equal], you probably wait until game time to make that announcement. It doesn’t make sense to do it any sooner.” Montreal has burned through four quarterbacks already this season, with\\xa0Drew Willy, Matt Shiltz and Jeff Mathews all getting injured — the Alouettes’ offensive line has allowed 23 sacks through six games — and Adams mostly ineffective in\\xa0Thursday night’s 44-23 home loss to the Edmonton Eskimos. During the game, fans chanted\\xa0“Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!” and “We want Johnny!” Some of them already had purchased Manziel jerseys. On Monday, the day Manziel began taking first-team snaps in practice, Adams expressed his extreme displeasure with that reaction. “Yes, it hurt me to hear that. I have nothing more to say or to give to the supporters of Montreal. Never again,” Adams\\xa0told La Presse, per TSN’s translation.\\xa0“Their behavior was very disrespectful. It was not like I was playing badly. I do not want them to ask me for anything, not even a small piece of equipment.” “I do not care what the situation is. It was a lack of respect and it affected me,” Adams continued.\\xa0“I tried anyways to make plays on the field. But that’s fine. In the future, I’ll treat the fans as they treated me. That’s all.” Adams’s frustration may stem from the fact that Manziel is about to cost him his second CFL job. The Tiger-Cats released Adams in June, ostensibly because they had signed Manziel to a two-year contract. Adams then signed with the Alouettes as a free agent, only to watch the team trade for Manziel. But before Thursday night’s game, he seemed to accept the fact that he would soon become the team’s backup, offering up much more measured comments than the “never again” diatribe he delivered after the loss. “Everybody knows Johnny didn’t come here to sit. They didn’t pay him just to sit. I understand he’s coming here to play,” Adams said. “As of right now, the Alouettes are [1-5]. I’m worried about winning a game. I’m not worried about what Johnny’s doing. “Coach gave me the start. I’m going to come out here, do my best, lead this team, be efficient on second down and just have fun. When I have fun, I play my best.” Manziel, who was not made available to reporters, apparently still has some work to do to get up to speed, though he said he was “getting there”:   #AlsMtl Day 2 prep, defence ramping up speed and it shows.

So we’re just trying to clean up the little detail things that I think we’re missing here that we’ll get on top of and hopefully be able to go out and perform.

Swimming at the\\xa0Far Western Long Course Championships in Moraga, Calif., Apuada finished the 100-meter butterfly in 1:09.38, besting Phelps’s 23-year-old, 10-and-under meet record of\\xa01:10.48 by more than a second. “That was one of my dreams — to beat Michael Phelps’s record — since I was 7,” Apuado said in the above video. In 1996, Phelps set the overall U.S. 10-and-under record for the 100 butterfly at\\xa01:08.54, a mark that since has been bested by Carson Foster in 2012 (1:07.24) and then Andrew Rogers, who broke the record twice at a 2015 meet in Texas. Rogers’s 1:05.98 still stands as the 10-and-under U.S. record in the 100 butterfly. Apuada, a rising fifth-grader who has been swimming competitively for four years, ended up with gold medals in every event he swam in at the meet, winning the 200 individual medley, 50 butterfly, 50 backstroke, 100 backstroke, 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle to go along with his 100 butterfly crown. As for his nickname, Apuada’s mother Cynthia told the Huffington Post that she always liked the name Clark and that her husband’s favorite superhero was Superman, and everything just flowed naturally from there. “We’re always just telling people his name is Clark. But when they realize his full name, people just call him Superman,” Cynthia Apuada said. Not to get too far into the (nerdy) weeds here, but Arthur Curry Apuada perhaps would have been a more apt name.

Happ beat the Royals in his Yankees debut Sunday. (Noah K. Murray/USA Today)   by Cindy Boren August 1 at 10:03 AM Email the author   Pitcher J.A. Happ, acquired by the New York Yankees in a trade late last week, has been diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, becoming the second Major League Baseball pitcher afflicted over the last two weeks. Happ was diagnosed with what the team said is a mild case; it is unclear how he came down with a viral disease most common among children under the age of 5. One possibility is that he was infected on a commercial cross-country flight after being traded Thursday by the Toronto Blue Jays. “I got a call from our trainer,” General Manager Brian Cashman told reporters. “He said, ‘I’m not sure what’s going on here, but J.A. Happ has some complaints. He’s not feeling right, and he had noticed some blistering.’ ” Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard was the first player afflicted this summer. He was placed on the 10-day disabled list with the illness, which is highly contagious, on July 22 after a start at Yankee Stadium. The Mets believe Syndergaard came down with the disease when he visited a kids’ camp over the all-star break. Syndergaard is expected to be activated Wednesday. The Yankees do not, for now, plan to place Happ on the disabled list. Happ is 11-6 after winning his Yankees debut Sunday, and Cashman said he “probably” would be able to start against the Red Sox in the four-game series that begins Thursday at Fenway Park. He is scheduled to pitch Saturday. “I can only convey to you what our internist who evaluated Happ conveyed to me,” Cashman said. “He feels currently this is a mild case, but he’ll stay connected.\\xa0We’ll be in a better position [Wednesday] to evaluate whether this is toward the tail end of this thing or if it’s ramping up.” For Syndergaard, one clue that he was ill came during a start in which the velocity of his pitches was low and he was having trouble breathing. Happ complained of blisters on his hands when he arrived at Yankee Stadium and was sent to New York Presbyterian Hospital.\\xa0Symptoms,\\xa0according to the Mayo Clinic, can include fever; sore throat; malaise; painful, blister-like lesions; and a red rash. Although people afflicted with the virus are most contagious during the first week, it can remain in the body for weeks after symptoms and signs are gone. Some people — especially adults — can pass the virus (often by coughing or sneezing) without showing any symptoms of the ailment. “There’s no real treatment. You just monitor the patient and let the virus take its course,” Cashman said. “He’s still scheduled to start. That’s not something that as of now is in jeopardy as of yet. . . . [O]ur internist felt if everything is as is right now, he probably would be able to go on Saturday.

For the first time, Williams managed to win only one game in a professional match, holding serve in the first set and then being bulldozed by Johanna Konta, 6-1, 6-0, on Tuesday night in the first round of the Silicon Valley Classic in San Jose. Williams’s loss eclipsed a 6-0, 6-2 drubbing she suffered at the hands of Simona Halep in the 2014 WTA finals in Singapore. Konta is 48th in the world, according to the WTA rankings. “I know I can play a zillion times better, so that kind of helps out, too. I have so many things on my mind I don’t have time to be shocked about a loss that clearly wasn’t at my best right now,” Williams said, via the Associated Press. “When I was out there, [I] was fighting. That’s the only thing I can say. I wasn’t just like giving it away, and I was moving a lot better. So I’m just trying to take the positives out of it.” Despite a run to the final at Wimbledon, Williams — 26th in the WTA rankings — has struggled at times during her return to competitive tennis to reach her typical level of play. She gave birth to her first child by Caesarean section last September and subsequently dealt with a litany of health issues, including\\xa0a pulmonary embolism. “It’s difficult, I guess,” she said Tuesday, speaking of her inability to regain her consistency and dominance. She then amended that comment: “Not, ‘I guess.’ For sure.” Despite her 6-3, 6-3 loss to Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon final, Williams appeared to gain some confidence in her game during that tournament, saying before the final,\\xa0“This is not inevitable for me” after a 13-month absence from the tour. Williams, who has worn compression shorts under her dress because of her history of blood clots, tearfully said after that loss that her mind-set had changed and that she was now playing for “all the moms out there.” What will the U.S. Open, the last Grand Slam event of the year, bring? “I didn’t know a couple of months ago where I was, where I would be, how I would do, how I would be able to come back,” she said after the Wimbledon loss, which came a little over a month after she withdrew from the French Open with a pectoral injury. “It was such a long way to see light at the end of the road, kind of. So I think these two weeks have really showed me that, okay, I can compete.” Read more from The Post: Rays going with unorthodox zero-starting-pitcher rotation Johnny Manziel says he feels ‘very blessed’ to get his first CFL start Friday night Athletes can easily trick popular concussion test, study finds ‘Our worst nightmare’: ESPN’s Samantha Ponder describes her newborn’s emergency surgery Bode Miller and his wife talk about their daughter’s drowning: ‘It happens in the blink of an eye’ Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen rips Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for his anthem stance — and for not following it himself LeBron James: Trump has used sports ‘to divide us’ ',\n",

In May, reliever Sergio Romo became the first pitcher since the Oakland Athletics’ Steve McCatty in 1980 to start on consecutive days after pitching at least one inning the first day (Romo had made zero starts in 588 career appearances before that two-game stretch). But Faria and then Snell were sent to the disabled list and then Archer was dealt to the Pirates, leaving Tampa Bay with zero starters, at least temporarily. Nominal reliever Ryne Stanek started Tuesday night’s game against the Los Angeles Angels, his 16th start of the season — the most among the Rays’ active players — and third in six days.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Neil Greenberg July 26 Email the author   The Washington Redskins have plenty to prove in 2018. Coach Jay Gruden, fresh off a two-year contract extension that keeps him in burgundy and gold through the 2020 season, has an underwhelming 28-35-1 record (a .445 winning percentage) and just one playoff appearance (2015) with the franchise. Yet his optimism runs high. “I\\xa0don’t think we really have any glaring\\xa0weakness,” Gruden said during his Wednesday news conference at the team’s training camp complex. “I think we have addressed a lot of them throughout the draft and free agency and the veteran guys here, and I think our depth has been\\xa0addressed, so now it’s just a matter of just going out and playing together.” [Projecting the Redskins’ 53-man roster as training camp gets underway] Gruden has a point.

Doctson 👀 #Redskins pic.twitter.com/We6pW9wSgu— Kimberley A. Martin (@ByKimberleyA) July 26, 2018    However, the absence of weaknesses is countered by a lack of perceived strengths and, as a result, the Redskins are not expected to be competitive in 2018; per the preseason point spreads released by CG Technology in May, Washington is favored in just four games this season, all at home: Week 2 vs. the Indianapolis Colts (-3),\\xa0Week 6 vs. the Carolina Panthers (-1),\\xa0Week 7 vs. the Dallas Cowboys (-1) and\\xa0Week 14 vs. the New York Giants (-1.5). Knowing the point spreads for each week allows us to project how many wins the Redskins will have in 2018. For example, a team that is favored by one point at home can be expected to win 51 percent of the time. Using this method for each of the 16 games of the season estimates Washington is most likely to finish 2018 having earned between five and eight wins, with a 7-9 record the most likely outcome. The Redskins have just a 31 percent chance of finishing 8-8 or better. Skeptical? This also falls in line with the over/under win total set at seven for Washington.     As you would expect, seven or even eight wins won’t be enough to contend for the division title, and it looks like the Redskins will finish last or second to last in the NFC East behind the Philadelphia Eagles and Cowboys.     According to Sharp Sports, Washington has the ninth-toughest schedule, and it will face six of the league’s top 10 toughest opponents. Two other opponents, the Panthers and Cowboys, rank 11th and 12th.    (sharpfootballstats.com)  The most challenging part of the schedule is toward the end of the season, when the Redskins will be on the road against the Cowboys (Week 12), Eagles (Week 13), Jacksonville Jaguars (Week 15) and Tennessee Titans (Week 16). Based on the preliminary point spreads, Washington has less than a 33 percent chance to win each of those games, making the first half of the season that much more important.     As you can see, there is little room for error, with Gruden and his squad needing to make the most of the season’s first half. If not, Washington could flounder more than expected, with the possibility of a four- or five-win season within reach.

(Alex Gallardo/Associated Press)   by Neil Greenberg July 27 Email the author   On Tuesday, Todd Gurley and the Los Angeles Rams agreed to a four-year contract extension with $45 million guaranteed, the largest guarantee ever given to a running back. The deal keeps the AP Offensive Player of the Year in line to wear a Los Angeles uniform through the 2023 season. Gurley is certainly worthy of the historic deal. The first-round pick in the 2015 draft carried the ball 279 times for 1,305 yards and a league-leading 13 touchdowns last season, adding 788 yards and six touchdowns on 64 catches. That made him one of the NFL’s most potent weapons at the position. [At a ‘young’ 34 years old, Redskins QB Alex Smith says ‘my best football’s still ahead of me’] Other rushers took notice — especially Pittsburgh Steelers all-pro running back Le’Veon Bell, who has yet to sign his one-year franchise tender to start what could be his final season with the franchise.

And that could be a mistake.   lol and ppl thought I was trippin?...— Le'Veon Bell (@LeVeonBell) July 24, 2018    Gurley, who turns 24 in August, has a couple of years left in his prime. Bell, at 26, does not. That might sound harsh for players who are only two years apart, but the life span of a running back in the NFL is not long. ESPN’s Bill Barnwell pointed this out, showing how even rushers at the top of the leader board don’t survive much longer than five years.   Put this in the column today but think it’s also worth mentioning in graphical form. Here are the leaders in passing, receiving, and rushing yards from five years ago (2013) per @pfref. The lines blotted out in red are for players who aren’t on an NFL roster. pic.twitter.com/L0005bW8N0— Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) July 25, 2018    Here’s another way to look at it, using the scoring format from point-per-reception, or PPR, leagues in fantasy football. It’s not a perfect measure of a running back’s performance, but it will illustrate how a top-performing running back ages. And it gives extra credit to do-it-all backs like Gurley and Bell, who not only carry the ball but catch passes out of the backfield as well. Since 2000, there have been 31 running backs who played in the NFL at age 21. More than half (17) improved their PPR point total the following year. The same rate of backs improved during their age-22 to age-23 season, and they kept improving until they reached 27. Then we started to see a decline — and it wasn’t a subtle one: Just over one-third of rushers (38 percent) improved their performance from 27 to 28. At 30 or older, the improvement rate slowed even more.     This is why taking a wait-and-see approach with Bell makes sense: Statistically speaking, he has one or two years left in his prime before he starts to decline. The same is true for David Johnson of the Arizona Cardinals. He turns 27 in December and, even through he has less mileage — 573 touches in 33 games over three seasons — his age is still a concern. Over the past decade, the amount of running backs who see 200 or more touches in a season peaks at age 25 and 26 and then starts a steady decline before almost falling off a cliff at age 29 and older. If the Cardinals’ front office decides to give Johnson a long-term deal with guaranteed money that extends into this age range, it is setting itself up for disappointment, as would any franchise in a similar situation.

(Nick Wass/Associated Press)   by Neil Greenberg July 30 Email the author   The MLB nonwaiver trade deadline is 4 p.m. Tuesday, and it’s time for the Washington Nationals, who are 52-53 and six games back in the National League East, to face reality and turn free agent contracts into future assets such as prospects and draft picks — and, yes, that includes six-time all-star outfielder Bryce Harper. Harper’s expected contract demands are well-known by now — his price tag projects to be north of $300 million — and with Washington so far in the rear-view mirror of true playoff contenders, it would make a lot of sense for the Nationals to convert Harper into future value. But General Manager Mike Rizzo seemed hesitant to commit to such a move when asked Wednesday by the Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan. [There is only one AL playoff spot up for grabs. Who’s excited?] “It would have to be a spectacular set of circumstances for us to do that,” Rizzo\\xa0said during the segment. “We’re going to do what we have to do to better this team for 2018 and beyond. That’s one of the superstars in the game and he’s a guy that is near and dear to my heart personally, and in Washington D.C., and is one of the great players in the game.” “Great” may be stretching it. Sure, Harper was the unanimous NL MVP in 2015 after an out-of-this-world campaign in which he hit .330 with a major-league leading 1.109 OPS and a league-leading 42 home runs, but that year has been the exception, with his other six seasons in the majors a mixed bag. Injuries limited him to less than a full season in 2014 and 2017, and he hit just .243 with 24 home runs in 147 games in 2016. He did add 21 stolen bases that season, but when looked at through the lens of wins above replacement (3.0 WAR, as calculated by FanGraphs) Harper was just the 12th-best NL outfielder that year. And that’s the kind of production the Nationals can expect if they hold on to Harper beyond Tuesday, at least according to\\xa0Dan Szymborski’s ZiPS projections and Steamer’s estimates for the rest of the season. According to those estimates, adjusted for projected playing time, Harper will hit .270 with 12 home runs, producing an additional 1.6 or 1.7 fWAR through the end of 2018. And that might be optimistic, considering the reasons Harper is struggling this season.    2018 regular season G PA HR R RBI SB AVG OPS fWAR   Bryce Harper (through Sunday) 103 450 25 63 62 8 .220 .842 1.6   ZiPS projections (rest of season) 50 215 12 33 33 4 .268 .923 1.6   Steamer projections (rest of season) 51 223 12 34 33 3 .271 .929 1.7    Harper has been struggling with fastballs, striking out in a career-high 25 percent of his plate appearances ending on that pitch. His walk rate this season is near where it was in 2015 (19.0 percent), but he is having trouble making contact on pitches up and away, lowering his overall OPS on these pitches to .994, compared with 1.117 last season and 1.196 in 2015.    Bryce Harper’s miss rate vs. fastballs in 2018 (TruMedia)  It’s conceivable that Harper makes an adjustment and lays off these pitches entirely during the rest of the season, but there is a more pressing issue: how often the defense has been using an infield shift when Harper is at the plate. The soon-to-be free agent\\xa0has faced\\xa0an infield shift in 192 of his 450 plate appearances (42.7 percent), resulting in a\\xa0batting average on balls in play of .240, leading him to create runs at a rate that is 58 percent lower than the league average after adjusting for league and park effects (42 wRC+). The\\xa0league average for BABIP against the shift is .298 this year, so it’s easy to see how much the shift is costing Harper.    Bryce Harper against the shift in 2018 (MLB)  With results like that, you can expect the shift to be used against Harper more, not less, making 1.7 fWAR over the next few months an optimistic projection. That also suggests the Nationals won’t get the boost they may be anticipating by keeping Harper on the roster. It also puts their playoff chances in serious doubt. [Nationals look listless as trade deadline approaches] Heading into Monday night’s games, Washington has a 42.5 percent chance at making the playoffs — not nearly high enough to justify keeping Harper on the roster past Tuesday’s deadline. It surely would take a lot for Washington to move Harper, and the team probably would only do so if it was certain it would not be able to re-sign him. But if the Nationals get a good enough offer, the smart move probably is to get a solid return on a slugger who more than likely won’t be able to lift his team into the postseason.

But as his former teammates are inching closer to Week 1 of the 2018 season, Hall insists he’s “great” and at peace with his decision. “Yeah, yeah, I feel good,” Hall said Wednesday morning before heading out to join his former teammates on the field. “I mean, didn’t like the way last year ended. Obviously, I would have liked to have been prepared to play and things like that. But things happen for a reason. My goal last year was to not have a surgery; to be a great teammate, the best teammate I could be; a good leader and not have a surgery, and I accomplished that. So it just felt right. “I tell people all the time, as a leader in the last couple years, I was always trying to groom the next crop of guys to take my spot, and when I finally felt like they were ready, or it showed they were ready, it was time for me to go.” Hall spoke glowingly about fourth-year cornerback Quinton Dunbar, who signed a three-year extension earlier this offseason. “He’s amazing. Amazing,” he said of Dunbar, who is aiming to solidify his position as the starting cornerback opposite veteran Josh Norman. “He’s been playing lights-out football. Look at the way he’s transformed his body a little bit and his mentality. He’s done what I would have expected him to do, so I’m not surprised. So I’m proud to say I had a hand in helping him become the person he is, the player he is. Because he’s going to be hell now. He’s going to be hell.” And the change in Dunbar isn’t just physical, according to Hall. “It’s all of it, it’s the combination, it’s the mentality,” he added. “He’s learned over these years how to be a corner, he’s learned how not to only be a corner but a football player. I always talk about football players. I don’t care about a great corner or a great receiver, I want a great football player. I think he’s shown his maturity and he’s able to be a great football player.” More Redskins coverage: Redskins RB Chris Thompson getting his ‘groove’ back as he nears full health Derrius Guice says Redskins running backs are enjoying themselves amid competition As new helmet rule creates confusion around NFL, Redskins unsure how it will be enforced ',\n",

The Doctson play was a fourth-and-goal from the 5-yard-line with nine seconds remaining. On the play, quarterback Alex Smith targeted Doctson in the shallow right corner of the end zone. Cornerback Josh Norman had shadowed the receiver’s every moment, so he launched himself as Doctson did. Doctson stretched his fingertips but the ball glanced off them and, as Doctson slammed to the muddy turf, Norman fell on top of him, with his helmet hitting Doctson in his upper-body. Norman popped up and walked up away but Doctson remained on the ground. He tried to get up but fell again. Smith ran over and Norman crouched down while they waited for an evaluation. Trainers eventually helped him inside while he held his left arm. [Former Redskins safety DeAngelo Hall swears — literally — that he is now retired] The former TCU star is about to begin his third season of the four-year, $10 million rookie deal Washington signed him to after drafting him 22nd overall in 2016. Injuries hampered Doctson from the start. He missed his entire rookie preseason with an Achilles injury, then returned to make his first career reception in the season-opener against Pittsburgh. He made one catch the next week, a 57-yarder against Dallas, but in Week 3, Doctson aggravated the Achilles injury during pregame warm-ups and he missed the rest of the season. Then, in 2017, Doctson pulled his hamstring and missed the preseason opener. He was injury-free for the rest of the year and hauled in his first career touchdown grab in Week 3 against Oakland. Doctson’s struggles to remain healthy reach back to college.\\xa0In 2015 at TCU, Doctson fractured his left hand in March and missed all of spring practice. He started the season on time, but later that year, against Oklahoma State, he fractured his left wrist and missed the last two games of his senior season, plus the Alamo Bowl. This year, Doctson has been building chemistry with new quarterback Alex Smith who, Doctson said, has shown more trust in his receivers more than last year’s starter, Kirk Cousins, did. Doctson is expected to take on a key role in the team’s passing game this season, as he demonstrated his ability to come down with contested catches last season and dating back to his college career. It is unclear at this time if he will miss any practice time.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Kareem Copeland August 1 at 6:33 AM Email the author   The player in all white at the Redskins’ fifth training camp practice already stood out against the backdrop of teammates in burgundy pants. Then all that white briefly turned into a blur on the left sideline, legs firing like pistons. This was the Chris Thompson fans are desperate to see. The Florida State product continues to work his way back from a fractured fibula that ended his 2017 season after 10 games. He’s finally reestablishing himself as a dangerous weapon out of the backfield, particularly in passing situations. Tuesday was the most work Thompson has received in training camp as coaches ease him back on the field. “Was a little nervous just getting out there at first,” Thompson said. “Overall it felt good. As I continued to get going, I kind of got in my groove again and was able to go out and make some plays. I was fine.” [As new helmet rule creates confusion around NFL, Redskins unsure how it will be enforced] Thompson’s best moment Tuesday came on a misdirection screen to the left in which Alex Smith tossed the ball a bit high toward his running back. Thompson was able to tip it to himself, gain control and turn up the sideline. The sight in front of him was green grass — and 300-plus-pound linemen. Thompson later caught a touchdown from Colt McCoy down near the 10-yard line. He came out of the backfield, gave linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons a shimmy to get open and caught a slant to score. “A touchdown,” Thompson replied when asked what he saw on the screen. “O-line did a great job blocking the corner and that was the only guy that was out there. The safety was on the far hash. “I would think in a game-time situation he wouldn’t catch me. But last year I did get caught by [Oakland’s} David Amerson, so I don’t know. I guess I’m not as fast as I thought I was. I think I would’ve had a chance to score on that screen play.” There is a bit of discussion of how fast Thompson is. He appears plenty quick and fast, with that burst he’s known for. He doesn’t necessarily feel that way though. “Little bit, not completely just yet,” Thompson said. “But everybody’s telling me I look fast and I look quick, so I’ll take their word for it. “Like the doctors told me, it’ll probably be 18 months [from the initial injury] before I’m feeling like myself again. If I look good to them right now, I’ll take that.” Thompson expects to continue to be limited at practice, but believes he’ll receive a similar amount of action in the next couple sessions before increasing his workload. The Redskins need him to be a versatile, change-of-pace back, part of an expected 1-2 punch with rookie Derrius Guice, for the offense to reach its potential in 2018. “When you’re talking about your best players Chris and Jordan [Reed] and Trent [Williams] and Morgan [Moses] and some of these guys,” Coach Jay Gruden said before practice, “they got to get out there and practice, but it’s sometimes you just want to treat them like a china doll. You’re like, ‘Oh, please don’t get hit.’ But eventually they’re going to have to put the pads on and practice. “And Chris is getting to a point right now, we’re going to put him in some team periods today, watch the reps he has and the defense will take good care of him because they know what kind of value he has to this football team. But, he’s coming along great and I anticipate him being full go sooner than later.” More on the\\xa0Redskins: Jamison Crowder-Alex Smith connection is starting to flourish Redskins rookie Tim Settle taking advantage of extra opportunities First-round pick Daron Payne out 2-3 weeks with ankle injury Vernon Davis confident in this year’s offense: ‘This is one of the best teams I’ve ever been on’ ',\n",

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Kareem Copeland August 1 at 3:07 PM Email the author   Speed was the most commonly used word in Paul Richardson’s scouting report when the Washington Redskins signed him in free agency this offseason, but that wasn’t all that was on display Wednesday. The new $40 million man showed off his hands and some toughness on what may have been his best practice of training camp. He had a reception of about 30 yards when he ran past Josh Norman and outstretched parallel to the ground to haul in an Alex Smith pass. The 6-foot, 170-pounder got behind another pair of defensive backs earlier, but Smith overthrew him. He added another touchdown in a short-yardage period where he put a nasty outside-in move on cornerback Quinton Dunbar after bouncing back from getting the wind knocked out of him a couple of plays earlier. Richardson had another diving catch for about 20 yards during the workout. “I’m comfortable every day,” Richardson said. “I’ve been comfortable since I got here. We’re just connecting, making plays. I see the ball and try to go get it. “We’re just throwing it more. We see a lot of things on film we want to get to. I think today was a day we really wanted to make a point to get to those things. Alex made it a priority to throw some of those corner routes, throw some of those deep balls, and we connected.” [Josh Doctson injures his shoulder during Redskins practice] Many observers continue to be skeptical about Smith’s ability to throw the deep ball, but that hasn’t been an issue during camp. The top three receivers of Richardson, Jamison Crowder, and Josh Doctson (who went down with a shoulder injury during practice, but later tweeted “#imgood”) have all had strong camps, but there’s a bit of a gap between them and the rest of the rotation. Maurice Harris, Brian Quick, Robert Davis and Trey Quinn have all had their moments, but the team kept just six receivers last season. Some won’t make the 53-man roster, and special teams ability will play a role in that decision. “Very important, if one guy can stand out on special teams, then that’s your fourth — period,” Coach Jay Gruden said. “You know, we understand that we have to improve on special teams instead of just saying that on the podium or in meeting rooms, we’re going to have to commit to it by maybe keeping somebody that is better on special teams, but maybe not quite as polished at receiver. “A lot of teams do that, but usually your fourth guy is going to be more of a true wide receiver. Your fifth guy could more in that role. So, we’ll have to wait and see even as a backup returner, a flier or whatever it might be.” [Former Redskins safety DeAngelo Hall swears — literally — that he is now retired] Play of the day Richardson had a couple plays that could have fit here, but there was a Jordan Reed reception that fans loved for a couple of reasons. Reed had a five-yard diving touchdown catch in the back of the end zone from Smith on a third-and-goal situation, in a preview of a connection that could be fruitful during the season. Reed seemed to get more physical work Wednesday than before, going through an individual blocking drill early in practice. The diving touchdown showed some trust in those two toes that underwent surgery, and was a reminder of how valuable of a target he can be at 6-2, 245 pounds with soft hands. Anderson running wild Second-year linebacker Ryan Anderson surprised many when he ended up in coverage against speedy running back Chris Thompson. The diminutive third-down back came out of the backfield and turned up the sideline with Anderson trailing. But Thompson didn’t pull away and the 6-5, 265-pound Anderson ran with him stride for stride. Anderson has been dealing with back spasms in training camp, but is expected to see an increased role in 2018. “As a rookie, I think a lot of the guys have high expectations,” Gruden said of the 2017 second-round pick, “of their coming in and leading the league in sacks and tackles and forced fumbles and passes batted down and all that stuff. But in reality, you’ve got to earn your stripes, especially if you’re playing behind somebody of great quality like Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith. “So, he’ll get his work and we’ll continue to work him. The big thing for him is to put practices back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back together [and] continue to get better. But I see steady improvement and growth from him in the weight room, his weight, his effort, so I like where Ryan’s at.” Roster moves The Redskins signed free agent linebacker Dadi Nicolas. To make room on the roster, they waived offensive linemen Alex Balducci. Nicolas was drafted in the sixth round of the 2016 draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. The 6-3, 239-pounder played 11 games as a rookie, but ruptured his patellar tendon in the playoffs and did not play in 2017.

Washington Manager Dave Martinez said Wednesday that the decision was made because Kelley’s behavior Tuesday night had been “disrespectful to the organization.” Kelley was told of the decision late Tuesday night.   Martínez said the team designated Kelley for assignment because slamming his glove last night was “disrespectful to the organization.” They informed Kelley late last night.— Jorge Castillo (@jorgecastillo) August 1, 2018      This seems related to last night’s outburst. Looked like he showed up his manager, though he said his frustrated glove toss was not related to that. https://t.co/IpjYqjpfAP— Chelsea Janes (@chelsea_janes) August 1, 2018    On what had otherwise been an encouraging night at the end of a long and emotionally grueling day, Kelley melted down. Asked to pitch the ninth inning with the Nats leading 25-1, the veteran allowed three runs on four hits, one of which was a two-run homer by Austin Jackson. After that pitch, Kelley slammed his glove to the ground and glared into the dugout. Even amateur interpreters might surmise that Kelley was not pleased to be pitching in that situation at all. “No, you can ask everybody in the bullpen. When [Wander] Suero’s pitch count got up, I said, ‘I’ve probably got the ninth.’ I figured I was the freshest reliever and I was going to throw the ninth,” Kelley said Tuesday night, adding that his frustration was due to disagreements with the umpires who were prodding him on his pace. “Like I said, for me, I’m not justifying it. I should not have thrown my glove and acted like a baby out there. But at the same time, I’m acting like it’s one to one for me. I’m giving it everything I’ve got.” [After a stress-packed deadline day, Nats hammer Mets in a laugher] Kelley recorded the final three outs, nonetheless, and the Nationals won, 25-4. Earlier in the day, the Nationals traded Brandon Kintzler to the Cubs. Mike Rizzo and Dave Martinez said one reason they felt they could make the deal was the emergence of Suero, who can pitch multiple innings and has proved himself resilient when handed heavy workloads. But when Suero’s pitch count climbed to 29, Martinez called on Kelley for the ninth inning. Just before the home run he allowed to Jackson, Kelley got into a heated conversation with second base umpire Tripp Gibson III. He had also had a back and forth with home plate umpire Adrian Johnson. He said he felt like calls pitchers were getting earlier in the game were not going his way. “[Johnson] told me to slow down. I was a) just trying to keep it going, and b) I’ve used the quick pitch sometimes. He told me to slow down one time, and the other guy behind me [at second base] told me I had to come set or it’s a balk,” Kelley said. “… Then the home plate umpire was telling me to hurry up. I was like, ‘But you told me to slow down.’ It was kind of frustrating. That’s all that was about.” [Svrluga: Nats hang on to Bryce Harper at deadline as Mike Rizzo bets on horses he rode in on] That glare into the dugout, however, casts unavoidable doubt about the true source of that frustration. Kelley’s teammates seemed to think so, too. After the game, Ryan Madson and Max Scherzer approached Kelley for a hushed conversation that did not get heated and ended with pats on the back. But conversations like those do not generally happen after a player shows frustration in a normal bad outing. Martinez said Tuesday that he thought Kelley was just frustrated with the umpires. “I think the homer, and the whole thing with trying to pitch fast and the umpire telling him to stop,” Martinez said. “He was arguing. I gather that’s what it was.” But whatever the reality of the situation, the incident raised questions on a day that initially looked like it would bolster the notion of team solidarity, not undermine it.

(Dylan Buell/Getty Images)   by Chelsea Janes July 31 at 7:47 PM Email the author   Trea Turner had tears in his eyes when he sat down in front of reporters Tuesday afternoon. He took a deep breath before he spoke, visibly shaken, as if a great weight had settled onto his shoulders in the day since racially insensitive and homophobic tweets from his college years resurfaced Sunday. No standard unit exists for measuring sincerity, but Turner, who\\xa0has never been one to show emotion, looked every bit like a man experiencing the reality of his guilt, not searching for a way to explain it away. “For starters, I want to apologize everybody that was affected by things that I said: LBGT community, African American community, special needs community,” Turner said, speaking without notes or a prepared speech in front of him, eyes welled. “I’m truly sorry for what I said and I want to take full responsibility for that. I want to apologize to my teammates, I just talked to them, make sure that they know my thoughts and where I’m at. I want to apologize to Mike Rizzo and the Nationals for bringing this distraction to their team, their organization, sorry for that as well. Most importantly, apologize to the fans. A lot of fans had been sharing their thoughts in the last few days and I’ve had a chance to read a few of them. I think that’s where it is most affected by what I said and I want to apologize to those people.” [Svrluga: When an athlete’s ugly tweets hit home, ‘it feels like an actual gut-punch’] Turner did not make excuses for the comments. He pointed out that being a teenager does not remove responsibility, that no matter how old he was, he should have known better than to use homophobic slurs or derogatory terms for members of the special needs community . “It’s not when I said the things I said,” Turner said. “It’s that I said them at all.” Nationals management and players did not give excuses for Turner, either. All vouched for the man they see every day. “It can’t be glossed over,” Rizzo said. “Those things are very, very serious,” Rizzo said. “… The Trea Turner I know since we brought him into the organization is a fine human being. He’s a fine person and a guy who conducts himself in a very dignified, classy manner.” “There’s really no room for that kind of talk or language in the game of baseball, or really America and in the world,” Adam Eaton said. “… That being said, the year and a half I’ve known Trea, he’s been an outstanding person in all walks of life — doesn’t matter if you’re gay or straight, black, purple, orange. He’s been an outstanding person to all of us.” Dave Martinez choked up when asked about his shortstop, who has stopped by to check on the rookie manager at tough points in the season and has emerged as a respected presence in the clubhouse during his short career. Martinez condemned the tweets, said the organization doesn’t condone those things. Then, when asked how he knew Turner was sincere in his apologies, Martinez teared up and pushed through a few cracks of his normally steady voice. “[Trea] started crying,” Martinez said. “That tells me he’s sincere.” Turner’s demeanor suggested sincerity, whatever such cues are worth in situations like these. He did not try to dodge responsibility. He acknowledged how moved he was by fan stories. As for whether his views have changed? “I don’t think that I’ve ever had those views that people are saying about me,” Turner said. “[But it’s] fair. I think you can definitely accuse me of that.” Sean Doolittle, who posted a lengthy Twitter thread about the need for players to be more careful about what they post on social media and what happens when they do not, said he does not think Turner’s tweets “reflect who he is now.” Doolittle has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBT community, as well as the need for acceptance more broadly. [Sean Doolittle: ‘There’s no place for racism, insensitive language or even casual homophobia’] “I think sometimes when you’re that age, you might know those things are wrong to say but maybe you don’t know anybody that’s been personally affected by them. It’s tough for you to really understand the damage, the real damage that they can and do cause,” Doolittle said. “… He has the opportunity to demonstrate that growth and we have to give that space for him to be able to demonstrate that he’s grown and he’s changed since then.” Turner said he is trying to determine the best way to demonstrate that growth, to use his platform for good instead of the hurt he caused with those tweets. “I think going forward I can do a lot more things, I just need to assess what’s important to me, what can make the biggest difference,” Turner said. “From reading the last few days, being a kid and things kids go through is kind of overlooked. That’s something I would like to take part in. I have in the past couple years done quite a bit through the team, but doing more and more is better.” Turner already participates in MLB’s Shred Hate initiative, an anti-bullying program for which he has spoken to children and filmed public service ads. He said he does not feel that is enough, nor did he point to that as a way to get himself off the hook. He did not point to anything like that, nor hunt for a way out of what happened. Even after his news conference, Turner sat quietly at his locker, where anyone who wanted to could press him further. As he headed out for batting practice, he passed a young Nationals fan with a sign that read “Go Trea Turner.” He knows not everyone shares the notion now. “A lot of times people says kids, kids, kids. Kids look up to you the most,” Turner said. “But there’s plenty of adults that have reached out to me that gave their side of the story. It’s not just one person, one community, it’s a lot of people in a lot different places doing a lot of different things. I think that’s something that athletes have to keep in mind. It’s not a niche, or a small community, or one person, it’s much larger.” Read more baseball coverage: Bryce Harper on Nationals considering trades: ‘Glad I’m still inside this clubhouse’ MLB trade deadline delivers fireworks, as five former all-stars dealt in the final two hours Red Sox get second baseman Ian Kinsler as Tuesday’s 4 p.m. trade deadline draws near In Roberto Osuna, the Astros acquire an all-star closer — and an ongoing domestic violence case Braves’ Sean Newcomb addresses ugly old tweets right after just missing a no-hitter ',\n",

(Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)   by Jorge Castillo August 1 at 11:25 AM Email the author   Brandon Kintzler did not report to Nationals Park on Tuesday afternoon thinking he had played his final game for the Washington Nationals. The trade deadline was approaching, but he thought he was safe. The reliever prepared for the club’s game against the New York Mets as usual. Then, about an hour before the 4 p.m. nonwaiver trade deadline, he was summoned to Manager Dave Martinez’s office. “Am I getting traded?” Kintzler asked. He was, he was told. Kintzler thought it was a joke. “Pretty shocked,” he said. After all the speculation swirling around the organization over the previous 24 hours, the only trade the Nationals completed before Tuesday’s deadline was shipping Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs, a National League playoff contender, for Jhon Romero, a minor league right-hander who hasn’t pitched above Class A. He owns a 3.27 ERA in 32 relief appearances for the Cubs’ high-A affiliate. He isn’t helping the big league club anytime soon. [Bryce Harper on Nationals considering trades: ‘Glad I’m still inside this clubhouse’] On the surface, trading Kintzler for a low-level prospect while keeping the rest of the team intact to make a run for a postseason berth is not sensible. The Nationals acquired Kintzler at the deadline exactly a year earlier as part of their midseason bullpen overhaul. He teamed up with Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson to solidify Washington’s relief corps last year. He was a valuable piece last season and has been this season. He has a 1.88 ERA in 14 1/3 innings since June 28. That was good enough for the Cubs, the National League Central’s first-place club, to add him. “I felt like I was throwing the ball well,” Kintzler said. “I can go help a contender, another contender, right now. I don’t know. Just shellshocked right now. At a loss for words.” The Nationals gave their reasons for trading Kintzler publicly, but a significant reason went unspoken. Club officials believed Kintzler was an anonymous source for reports that cited clubhouse strife, according to people with knowledge of the situation. In a radio interview on 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday, Kintzler denied he was a source for Yahoo’s recent story, which called the Nationals’ clubhouse “a mess.” “I’ve never talked to that [author] Jeff Passan guy in my life, so that’s an interesting accusation,” Kintzler said on “Grant & Danny.” “I know for a fact that someone got him to admit his source was not a player, so it wasn’t me. I’ve never talked to that guy in my life.” Martinez said the reason Washington traded Kintzler was to give the spot to Wander Suero, who can pitch multiple innings and provide length. Suero was called up from Class AAA Syracuse about an hour before Tuesday’s game against the Mets. Martinez said the club figured Madson, recently acquired Kelvin Herrera and Sean Doolittle, whenever he comes off the disabled list, composed a strong enough back end. Dealing from that surplus allowed the team to address another need, Martinez explained. “I think that’s missing in the bullpen,” Martinez said. “Look, Brandon was awesome. He got some big outs for us, he really did. Of course, he’s going to be missed in the bullpen, but I think moving forward having some length to go with [Matt Grace] is important. It really is.” Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said he believed Suero deserved a spot in the majors and will be a vital piece in the future. The 26-year-old Suero has pitched to a 3.15 ERA in 16 games in a couple stints for the Nationals this season. He lasted appeared in a game for Washington on July 14, when he tossed 2 2/3 scoreless innings. [Svrluga: Nats hang on to Bryce Harper at deadline as Mike Rizzo bets on horses he rode in on] Rizzo hinted that Koda Glover, who has made eight minor league appearances after missing the season’s first four months with a shoulder injury, could join the team soon to bolster the bullpen. He also suggested moving Kintzler was, to some extent, financially motivated. Kintzler has a mutual option for next season; if the team doesn’t pick up a $10 million team option, he can pick up a $5 million player option. “It gives us financial flexibility, this year and next year going forward,” Rizzo said. “And we felt it was the prudent move, like all the moves we make, with 2018 and beyond in mind.” That mutual option is part of the contract Kintzler signed with the Nationals in December. He received offers on the table from other teams for more money and a more prominent role, but chose the Nationals because he liked the clubhouse and the organization. He felt at home. Teammates got along with him. He was close with Doolittle and Max Scherzer, often bouncing ideas off them.\\xa0 He played the role of pitching coach, helping Tanner Roark and Gio Gonzalez with their mechanics during their struggles this season. His presence was felt. “He helped me a lot in my career just in the years that we spent together so I’m going to miss him,” Doolittle said. “We’re going to miss his ability on the field. I think we’re going to miss him in the clubhouse as well.” But he also rubbed some people the wrong way because he was willing to speak his mind more than others. Perhaps that was the lone\\xa0 factor in the Nationals’ decision. Regardless, Kintzler is a Cub now, and he didn’t see it coming. “In the beginning, you care because it’s your character,” Kintzler said. “I work really hard, I feel like, to be a good teammate. I always thought I was a good teammate and everyone in that clubhouse thought I was a good teammate. When someone tries to say something about your character as far as how you are in the clubhouse, that hurts a little bit, but it’s just an opinion of one person and they can think what they want. I thought I did a good job there. New beginnings today and it is what it is. Put it behind me and I can’t wait to face them next week.” Scott Allen contributed to this report.

I’ve never talked to that guy in my life.” Rizzo didn’t explicitly acknowledge that clubhouse culture was the reasoning behind the Kintzler deal but did not reject the premise when asked whether his decisions on Kintzler and Kelley represented a shift in mentality about players who undermine their manager. “We’ve always had that stance. We’ve always had a stance that if you’re not with us, you’re against us, and you’re in the way,” Rizzo said. “The culture here has been so good for so long.

That, in itself, should demonstrate the frustration the front office felt at his outburst and the optics it created for a team already answering questions about its clubhouse culture. Without him, the Nationals have lost two of their most outspoken veterans in the bullpen, leaving Madson, injured Sean Doolittle and newcomer Kelvin Herrera as the longest-tenured members of that corps. “Those are two guys within our bullpen, two of our more vocal guys. They were vocal leaders, and they led that way,” Doolittle said. “Now it’s going to fall on somebody to kind of step up and assume that role.” The Nationals recalled right-hander Jimmy Cordero to replace Kelley on the roster. The 26-year-old is pitching to a 1.88 ERA in 38 games for Syracuse this season and has struck out more than a batter per inning. In Cordero and Wander Suero, the Nationals get two durable, versatile relievers who can provide them multiple innings. Kintzler and Kelley, as more veteran players with injury histories, limited Martinez’s options more. But jettisoning Kelley was not about on-field performance. Rizzo left no doubt about that.

(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)  Darren Mattocks is enjoying the most productive season in his seven-year pro career — and the campaign is only half over. In his first summer in Washington, the Jamaican forward shares D.C. United’s scoring lead with eight goals, an average of one every other appearance, and has helped lift an attack that last seas matched the MLS record for scoreless games. Mattocks, however, plays the same position as Wayne Rooney, the English superstar who arrived this month to bolster the organization both on and off the field. As Ben Olsen said, “We didn’t get Wayne to come off the bench for 15-20 minutes.” [Rooney named United’s team captain after three matches in MLS] And so the coach has had to strike a tricky balance of integrating Rooney while providing enough minutes to Mattocks to sustain both his production and spirit. “It’s a work in progress, if I am being honest,” Mattocks said Friday. “It’s not perfect. That’s pretty much all I can say.” Before Rooney’s arrival, Mattocks started 12 matches, entered as a sub once and did not play once while compiling all of his goals, including five in a recent six-game stretch for last-place United (3-9-5). Since Rooney’s arrival, he has not scored in two starts (in which he gave way to Rooney shortly after intermission) or as a second-half sub for his new teammate. Rooney is likely to start Saturday against the Colorado Rapids at Audi Field and, as his fitness level continues to grow, he is almost certain to become Olsen’s first choice in a system designed for one striker only. “It’s not an easy situation for Darren. I feel for him,” Olsen said. “However, this is professional soccer and he is going to have to do the best he can with the situation. .\\u2009.\\u2009.\\xa0It’s a tough adjustment. There is only so much I can say to him because in a lot of ways it isn’t fair.” Mattocks vented a bit Wednesday after leaving the field in the 57th minute, noticeably frustrated by the early removal. “He doesn’t want to be subbed. I understand his frustration, and some of it is warranted,” Olsen said. “But this is our new reality: How you deal with the circumstances is the important thing. I trust Darren’s character. He is a team guy and ultimately wants what is best for himself but for this team. There is enough of a foundation between us and in him to deal with this in the right way.” In talking about the situation Friday, Mattocks seemed to carry a mix of disappointment and understanding. “If you are looking long term, it’s going to affect my output if I get less playing time,” he said. “The more I play, the more I score. The first half of the season, I’ve been doing it. With Wayne coming in, overall it’s good for the team, but maybe I am going to be affected the most. “It’s tough to keep everyone happy in this situation. You have got to understand the business aspect of it — what he brings to the table — but at the same time, it doesn’t keep everyone happy. For the team’s sake, you have to put the team first.” Beyond the goals, Olsen has admired Mattocks’s attitude and work rate. “He’s a lovely guy,” Olsen said. “The way he has come in here and helped us in the goal department, but also he has worked harder than he has ever worked in his career. He has given us everything he has had and we expect him to continue to do it.” Even if he does lose the starting job, Mattocks will remain in Olsen’s plans. Rooney is on the back end of his career and won’t play 90 minutes every game, especially when United faces three matches in a week (as the team will have to do four more times). Olsen said his message to Mattocks is: “Take advantage of those minutes, so you can make my life difficult and lean toward putting you on with Wayne. Make it so I can’t keep you out of the lineup.” Olsen will stick with his one-forward alignment for the time being but has not ruled out a change that would partner Mattocks and Rooney on the front line or put Mattocks up front and Rooney in a withdrawn position. “Right now, I don’t think we’re there,” he said of a possible new formation. “We’re still trending in the right direction [in creating opportunities]. We have to see how this looks before we make any adjustments.” As for Rooney’s position, “We haven’t come to a conclusion yet where Wayne is going to play permanently for this team.” Olsen then added, “but the reality is, he is going to play.” United notes: D.C. remains in the market for defensive help, especially on the corners, before the transfer and trade window closes Aug. 8, Olsen said. .\\u2009.\\u2009.

United’s 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rapids on Saturday with his first MLS goal, a broken nose and a gash over his left eye that sent blood pouring down his face and later required five stitches. United brought the English superstar to Washington to score goals and turn its fortunes on and off the field. In his first start at the new venue, wearing the captain’s armband, Rooney also showed he has no intention of coasting into retirement. Defending a corner kick in stoppage time, Rooney mixed it up with Axel Sjoberg, Colorado’s 6-foot-7 center back, and took a blow to the head. As he received medical treatment on the sideline, he stole glances of the action as his shorthanded team clinched three points before a crowd of 18,931.   Welcome to #MLS, Wayne Rooney!He's bleeding profusely after taking a blow to the face. That kind of makes him look like an English medieval knight.#DCvCOL #DCU #WelcomeWayne pic.twitter.com/Ddwm6QIZ0h— Jason Foster (@JogaBonito_USA) July 29, 2018    “I don’t think it’s the first time he has bled. He is a pretty tough guy,” said Coach Ben Olsen, whose dress shirt had been stained with blood after embracing his star forward. “It shows you what this means to him right now. He’s in the box, putting his face on the line, understanding that’s a big moment. We needed that play to get out of that spot.” [Wayne Rooney named D.C. United captain after three MLS matches] Rooney, whose acquisition last month was the priciest in United history, will continue to undergo evaluation. His status for next Saturday’s match at Montreal is unclear. Well before the injury, Rooney had provided the lead by slotting an angled shot between goalkeeper Tim Howard’s legs. He also hit the post in the second half and mixed well with Luciano Acosta, Yamil Asad and Zoltan Stieber in creating danger throughout the night. United failed to put the result out of reach and, after conceding the 82nd-minute equalizer, went ahead in the 90th on an own goal. Ulises Segura, a late sub who this past week returned from a knee injury, crossed from the end line in hope of making something happen. The ball caromed off Colorado’s Niki Jackson and past Howard. [Darren Mattocks is having a career year. The problem? He’s not Wayne Rooney] “It’s never luck,” Segura, a Costa Rican midfielder, said through an interpreter. “Whenever you get in the box like that, you try to hit it as hard as you can. So it either hits one of your teammates or hits a defender and you get something out of it.” Olsen admired his team’s resiliency, saying “to come back and find a goal – okay, it’s a little fortunate – I am very proud of them.” With a third match in eight days and his team struggling to earn points, Olsen shook up the lineup. Kofi Opare and Russell Canouse, both sidelined much of the year with injuries, made their first starts and Junior Moreno was in the lineup for the first time since early June. Canouse, who had been terrific as a sub for three matches, was a force in central midfield for United (4-9-5). “He’s physical. He’s relentless and he’s a fighter,” Olsen said. “It was nice to have that out there tonight because at times we have missed that.” Rooney’s return to the lineup, at the expense of eight-goal scorer Darren Mattocks, was expected all along after he started last weekend at Atlanta and came off the bench in Wednesday’s 1-0 defeat to the New York Red Bulls.   Wayne Rooney opens his MLS account! #DCvCOL https://t.co/XuKvh1sVea— Major League Soccer (@MLS) July 29, 2018    United set the terms in the first half, but thanks to a suspect call, Colorado (4-12-5) had the first genuine opportunity with a 26th-minute penalty kick. With a challenge from behind on Edgar Castillo, Moreno might have nicked the outside back’s heel. Castillo went airborne. Referee Ramy Touchen was convinced. The video assistant referee did not intervene. Acosta, a U.S. national team midfielder acquired last week from Dallas, stung the penalty kick off the right post. After the scare, United returned to form and went ahead on a well-crafted goal. Moreno won a tackle in the center circle. Stieber linked with Luciano Acosta, who spotted Rooney making a run and supplied a fine ball into the box. Rooney let the ball do the work, using a clever sidestep to put defender Tommy Smith off-balance. As Howard came off his line, Rooney used his first touch to place an angled, eight-yard bid between the charging goalkeeper’s legs. Rooney and Howard had been Manchester United teammates for two\\xa0years and Premier League opponents for 10 before Howard moved to MLS in 2016. United was the better side for most of the night but couldn’t expand the lead. In a three-minute span early in the second half, D.C. had three prime opportunities to extend the lead: Acosta’s cheeky footwork led to a tight-angled shot over Howard and off the top of the crossbar; Howard made a hand save on Rooney’s threat, pushing it off the back post; and Rooney’s heavy touch in the box allowed Howard to smother the ball before a shot attempt. United’s inability to score again came back to haunt it when Jack McBean played a diagonal ball to Kellyn Acosta blazing into the box on the right side. David Ousted charged off his line, but Acosta chipped it over both the goalkeeper and leaping defender Steve Birnbaum. United was crestfallen, a disappointing draw seemingly inevitable. But a hopeful cross reversed its fortunes again and provided a badly needed three points. “For confidence and morale, a win was important,” Opare said. “The results haven’t been great, but we believe in each other. And to bounce back from their goal shows the character of this group.” United notes: Midfielder Paul Arriola served a one-game suspension for yellow-card accumulation. … D.C. will visit the Montreal Impact next weekend before returning home Aug. 12 to face Orlando City.

(Anne-Marie Sorvin/USA Today Sports)   by Steven Goff July 29 Email the author   If Bayern Munich had any second thoughts about spending up to $22 million in transfer fees last week on a Canadian teenage attacker with no MLS goals before this year, they were put to rest in a ferocious and spectacular performance Saturday at Vancouver’s BC Place. Three months and a few days short of his 18th birthday, Alphonso Davies looked very much like someone ready to take the next step in his dawning soccer career and fulfill the massive expectations that are sure to shadow him to Bavaria this winter. He played a part in every Whitecaps goal, scoring twice on breathtaking sequences and assisting twice during a 4-2 victory over Minnesota United. While he was making outrageous runs in the Pacific Northwest, his future employer was in Miami with an American teenager in the starting lineup for a preseason friendly: defender Chris Richards, 18, on loan from FC Dallas. He will play for Bayern’s under-19 squad this season, but this summer Richards has entered as a substitute against Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus and played 90 minutes against Manchester City. Because he is too young for a formal transfer, Davies will remain with the Whitecaps through the end of the season and join Bayern Munich when the German transfer window reopens in January. The fee from the Bundesliga titans — a base of $13 million, with clauses that could result in additional payments — is the largest for an MLS player in the league’s 22-year history, besting the $11.6 million that Spanish side Villarreal spent 10 years ago on Jozy Altidore, then with the New York Red Bulls. The Whitecaps have pledged to pour that money into the sporting side of the club, such as youth development and player acquisitions. “He’s got a massive future, and it’s really up to him how far he goes,” said Minnesota defender Michael Boxall, who was burned by Davies on the first goal. “He’s got a great opportunity ahead of him.” He will carry a compelling personal story with him to Europe: Born in a Ghanaian refugee camp to parents fleeing civil war in Liberia, he relocated with his family to Ontario at age 5 before settling in Alberta. An Edmonton youth club that helped groom him will receive a small share of the Bayern transfer fee, a FIFA-required solidarity payment that MLS’s U.S. teams, citing antitrust laws, ignore. Davies’s career began to take shape in earnest at the Whitecaps’ youth academy three summers ago. Within six months, he had signed with the club’s lower-tier team in the United Soccer League. By the summer of 2016, at age 15, he had upgraded to an MLS contract. With the first team, he started twice in 2016 and nine times last year before becoming a regular this season. With European clubs monitoring him, he has scored five times and posted 10 assists in 21 regular season matches, which earned him a share of fourth place on the league charts entering Sunday’s matches. Davies scored a terrific individual goal against D.C. United in the Audi Field grand opening two weeks ago. He met with Bayern officials last week in Philadelphia, where the German club began a U.S. tour. A deal soon was finalized. He then returned to Vancouver for Saturday’s sensational performance, assisting on Yordy Reyna’s sublime goal in the 35th minute, beating three players in tight space to score in the 56th, setting up Kei Kamara on a two-on-one in the 64th and splitting two defenders and finding the top corner of the net in the 89th.   Simply amazing, @AlphonsoDavies 🙌 pic.twitter.com/Gh48fQZGrx— Major League Soccer (@MLS) July 29, 2018    Putting the Bayern deal to rest and rejoining the Whitecaps, he said, “was a weight off my shoulders after all the travel and meetings.” After a slow start — “the first 20 [minutes were] as bad as I’ve seen him play,” Coach Carl Robinson said — Davies hit his stride. “Another bit of magic,” Robinson said of Davies’s second goal. Davies is making gains on the senior international level as well, making six appearances since he became a naturalized citizen in early 2017 and scoring three goals in Canada’s first two matches at the Concacaf Gold Cup last summer. He was the youngest in tournament history to score, was named the best young player in the event and made the Best XI squad. Canada hasn’t qualified for the World Cup since 1986 and has produced few world-class players. Calgary’s Owen Hargreaves, signed by Bayern Munich in 1999, is an exception, though he opted to play for England on the international level. In Davies, however, the country has a brighter future. “We know he is a wonderful talent,” Robinson said. “We know he’s got ability. He’s got potential, but when he keeps playing like that, that’s not potential — that’s reality.” More on soccer: Wayne Rooney scores first MLS goal as D.C.

(Steven Goff/The Washington Post)   by Steven Goff July 31 at 2:56 PM Email the author   D.C. United’s Wayne Rooney returned to work Tuesday looking as if he had stepped into a boxing ring over the weekend. Bruises enveloped his left eye, and five stitches ran from the eyebrow to the bridge of his broken nose. “It looks a bit worse with the black eye,”\\xa0he said after participating in the training session, “but it feels fine.” Rooney and the team declared him available for the MLS match Saturday at Montreal, saying he had cleared two concussion tests and would not need significant treatment for the wounds, which were inflicted in the waning moments of a 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rapids on Saturday at Audi Field. Rooney was in the penalty area, helping to defend a corner kick in the fourth of five additional minutes, when Colorado’s Tommy Smith crashed into teammate Axel Sjoberg and created a chain reaction. The back of Sjoberg’s head then rammed Rooney’s face. Rooney fell, and when he got back up, his face was a bloody mess. Medical staff tended to him on the sideline as shorthanded United ran out the clock. “It was a complete accident,” Rooney said. “These things happen.” He said he has broken his nose “a few times” during his 16-year career and that “it’s part of football. I’m used to it.” He said he would be ready to play this weekend — “no problem” — and did not plan to wear a molded face mask. “It will be fine. It’s actually settled down quite quick,” he said. “There’s not much swelling. … I’ve had no problems sleeping. I’ll play as normal. Of course, if I get a bang on it, it will be painful.” United tested him for a concussion after the match and again Tuesday. Results were negative. Still, Coach Ben Olsen said, “We’ll be a little cautious with him this week.” Olsen said Rooney “doesn’t seem too bothered by it. … The thing to worry there is with the concussion stuff. The cuts heal. We all have broken noses; almost every guy out here has one. All of us can only breathe through one nostril. It’s part of the gig.” Rooney’s commitment to the cause, battling an opponent (Sjoberg) with a 10-inch height advantage, left an impression on his teammates. “He took one off the face to make sure nothing happened,” said goalkeeper David Ousted, who was also responsible for preventing Sjoberg from making contact. “It’s the kind of guy he is and the kind of guy we appreciate.” The incident came in Rooney’s first match as team captain, a title awarded after just a month with his new team. “It’s something you know these young players need,” said the former Manchester United and English national team captain. “I’ve been there as a young player. I remember as a young player getting advice from the likes of Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes — it’s what you want to take in if you want to take advice. If you don’t, that’s your decision. I can only be there to help.” The injury also came on the day he scored his first MLS goal, a 33rd-minute strike between goalkeeper Tim Howard’s legs. United conceded Kellyn Acosta’s equalizer in the 82nd minute and went back ahead on an own goal in the 90th. Aside from the injury forcing him to the sideline, Rooney went the distance after totaling 131 minutes in the first three outings. Barring any setbacks this week, Olsen hopes to play him most, if not all, of this weekend’s game. “This was the plan all along, to build him up to this point,” Olsen said. “It’s still a little bit fast, but that’s just the reality of coming in halfway through the season. If this was preseason, maybe it would be another week. He did a very good job in the offseason to maintain a level of fitness where he didn’t come in here unfit.” Rooney added, “I feel like I am up to speed.” His adaptation into the attack remains a promising work in progress as he bonds with Luciano Acosta, Yamil Asad, Zoltan Stieber and Paul Arriola. “We’ve created chances,” Rooney said. “If we had been more clinical in the last game, we could have been two or three-nil up and the game is finished. But it’s nice as an attacking player when you are creating chances. There are real positive signs.” Notes: With eight days left in the transfer and trade window, Olsen said the team is “still looking” for roster help, particularly at outside back. Taylor Kemp, the incumbent at left back, will miss the entire year with a hip injury and first-choice right back Nick DeLeon continues to struggle with a knee injury that has cost him eight games. … The club will offer a free ticket to a future match for fans who were not able to gain entrance to Audi Field last weekend because of a strict clear bag policy. The situation affected about 50 people, spokesman Chris Hull said. “It may be a small number, but it’s far too many,” he said. United implemented the guidelines a year before it will become mandatory at all MLS venues. The team has pledged to improve communication about the policy by prominently posting it on digital game tickets and social media and by stationing customer-service officials at the gates. The team is also reviewing its relationship with a third-party vendor, which did not provide enough lockers for fans to store belongings outside the stadium. Long lines formed Saturday, prompting some fans to leave or stash their bags unprotected outside the stadium. United will also review the $20 charge for a locker and whether to distribute clear bags for free or a minimal charge. The next home match is Aug. 12 against Orlando City.

(David ‘Dee’ Delgado/ for The Washington Post)   by Rick Maese July 28 Email the author   NEW YORK — When the last Philadelphia hero had been eliminated and left motionless on the animated map, the players removed their hands from the controls, confetti fluttered through the air and triumphant music blasted through the public-address system at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Fans were on their feet cheering, hoisting their smart phones to record the moment: the first championship of the Overwatch League. The London Spitfire toppled the underdog Philadelphia Fusion on Saturday afternoon, an important mile-marker for a first-year league that began play in January with designs on revolutionizing the way esports is played, structured and consumed. The confetti, the costumed fans, the raucous atmosphere – it was as much part of the OWL dream as it was the league’s blueprint. Saturday marked the culmination of the inaugural season, and while the upstart league has touted it as a huge success, it was only a step. The looming transition to the local markets will ultimately define the success of not just the league but also whether its ambitious model can truly reshape the esports landscape. “The city-based format has really taken off in a faster and in a bigger way than I had expected,” said Nate Nanzer, the league commissioner, “and, frankly, like I knew it would work — for all the reasons that work in traditional sports. I just thought it would maybe take more time.” The league (OWL) wasn’t built to be a get-rich-quick scheme. It aims to have the staying power and popularity of traditional sports leagues like the NBA or NFL, connecting with communities the way the New York Yankees or New England Patriots do, and producing revenues that blur the line between games and sports. [With Overwatch League Grand Finals, esports takes over Brooklyn to the roar of thunderous applause] “I think it is still a long-term play. One year in a sports league is immaterial,” said Jonathan Kraft, president of the Kraft Group, which owns the OWL’s Boston Uprising franchise and also the New England Patriots. “We did this with an eye towards building long-term asset value.” Long before Saturday’s championship formally brought the inaugural season to a close, OWL officials had been busy plotting out Season 2 and beyond. ESPN reported recently that the league is finalizing agreements with three expansion franchises – one in Atlanta, one in Paris and another in Guangzhou, China – and as many as three more could be on the way, each selling for $30-60 million. And while the league’s most fervent fans are accustomed to following OWL games via the live-streaming video service Twitch, the league also signed a broadcast deal this month that will put future matches on ESPN and Disney channels. While the league’s online numbers exceeded expectations for many team executives – the broadcasts averaged anywhere from 80,000 to 170,000 concurrent viewers — team and league officials feel certain their Year 1 successes are only a preview of what’s to come. They think the league is still rolling down the runway, and though there are some potential obstacles ahead, they feel they’re following a blueprint that will revolutionize esports. “If Overwatch League is successful, it’s inherently changed the model for every publisher, for every league and for every team that exists in the world,” said Noah Whinston, the chief executive of the Los Angeles Valiant franchise. “Having a localized model at this scale has never been attempted before. If this league is successful, I think it throws a lot of conventional wisdom about esports completely off the table.”   350k viewers on @Twitch - you better bet that 400k was easily within reach if this went the distance, maybe even half a million. Still, have to imagine that + ESPN + Disney is a great result.— Ben Goldhaber (@FishStix) July 28, 2018    A global league’s local vision The two squads of players sat on a stage at one end of the arena, dwarfed by the giant video scoreboard overhead. The favored London Spitfire squad consisted of six Korean gamers, all of whom would be carded by any bartender in Brooklyn, and the Philadelphia Fusion featured six players from five different countries. None of the players on the stage was American and none had any tangible connection to the city he’d been representing these past four months. The novelty of OWL is its geolocating model in which the 12 franchises are tied to specific cities, just like traditional sports leagues. It’s a novel formula and based on the early returns, Blizzard, the game’s publisher, could eventually use the same approach with other titles, most notably Call of Duty, a popular esports title for the past dozen years. [ESPN secures Overwatch League broadcast rights, continuing esports’ mainstream surge] But in Year 1 of OWL, all the teams were actually located in the Los Angeles area, playing their matches at the same 450-seat Burbank, Calif., studio that formerly hosted “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.” That will be the Year 2 arrangement too. But owners are hopeful that in Year 3 – 2020 – the teams will relocate to their actual cities, which will open up new revenue streams. A report from the market research company Newzoo earlier this year suggested global esports revenues will top $900 million this year and will nearly double in the next three years. The OWL teams know that money is out there, which is why franchise rights for the initial 12 teams sold for $20 million apiece. “Ultimately, to really be a force — to create the types of monetization that you’d like to have on a local basis, the team has to be in-market more regularly,” Kraft said.    Fans of London Spitfire celebrate the win (David ‘Dee’ Delgado/For The Washington Post)  The league sought out owners who have experience in traditional sports, who understand cultivating an audience in a local market. The OWL owners include the Kraft family, Fred Wilpon, who owns the New York Mets, and Stan Kroenke, who owns the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Rams. But with the squads representing cities in name only, there’s only so much they can do with that knowledge. Teams have hosted watch parties and tried to generate local media interest but opportunities are inherently limited. Estimates suggest as many as 150 million people watch esports globally, a figure that is expected to only grow in coming years. But the league wants a particularly avid following to bloom in the league’s hand-picked cities. They can then leverage that fandom and create revenue streams: ticket sales, merchandising, local sponsorships, community partnerships. “I think monetization is the core issue in esports,” Whinston said. “We all know how big the audience is. … We’re still a long way away from generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue on an annual basis, but I think we’ve made the right steps to start proving out the different pieces to the model.” [Overwatch League’s Grand Finals provide a crucial esports lesson: Adapt or die] Kraft likens the league’s Season 1 core audience to low-hanging fruit, largely gamers who didn’t need much arm-twisting. The challenge down the road will be growing beyond that. “I think to start to attract and educate casual fans and bring the geographic connection in — I think of people who don’t love hockey but say, ‘The Bruins are my team because they live in Boston,’” he said. “I think you have to be in-market to fully take advantage of that.” “Once it comes into the market, those less-than-avid fans then have a reason to start paying attention. That’s when we’ll really have to kick it into high gear,” he continued. “Look, the league launched very successfully, no one can dispute that. … And we’ll just get stronger next year. But the next real big test will be when we go in-market in 2020.”    Cosplayers dressed as their favorite characters in Overwatch for the first-ever finals (David ‘Dee’ Delgado/For The Washington Post)  Can a game become a pastime? Overwatch, barely two years old, already has a loyal following. The fans who flooded Brooklyn – many of whom lined up hours before the Barclay Center doors opened — wore gear representing all 12 of the league’s teams, many featuring the names of specific players across their shoulders. Many others came dressed in costume as the game’s heroes – Sombra, Zarya, Widowmaker and even Wrecking Ball, a new hamster character introduced last month, among them — and seemed to connect with the characters in the game as much as the players using them. In the arena, the players sat mostly still on the stage, their hands doing all the work unseen, their heads shielded from the crowd by monitors. Most of the action took place on the gigantic videoboard overhead. Overwatch is a six-on-six shooter game, a futuristic adventure that is both the reason for the league’s instant success and perhaps a slight cause for trepidation. Even as the league took off this spring, many gamers started gravitating this year to another title. Fortnite became undoubtedly the game of the moment, reportedly topping 125 million players and bringing in $1 million a day. “What Fortnite has done is absolutely incredible,” said Tucker Roberts, president of the Fusion franchise. “It’s pulling fans right now from Overwatch, League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike — all the biggest games that have been around for years. It’s no joke. … But I don’t think that will persist forever.” Fortnite and its battle royale format don’t lend itself to a team-based league, and OWL officials are quick to point out that there are always new titles. Even if some temporarily siphon off players, the good games — think: StarCraft, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Warcraft – tend to have staying power. [Are pro athletes playing too much Fortnite? Some teams are worried.] “From my perspective, the fears of esports fads and games coming in and out of favor is a little overblown,” said Whinston. “Of course, there are casual fans that will move from game to game, but I think it’s overly simplistic to say, ‘Well, a new game will come along and Overwatch will fall out of popularity.’” The key is evolution. Updates, new maps, new characters, new technology. And unlike traditional sports, esports has the ability to tweak its games at any time, even during a season. Blizzard makes regular Overwatch updates and this year even introduced a new character midway through the season, which forced teams to change strategies and upended the league hierarchy. As a result, the best regular-season team, the New York Excelsior, was ousted in the OWL semifinals. The Fusion, which sneaked into the playoffs with the sixth and final roster spot, instead found itself in Brooklyn this weekend. While baseball or football would never fundamentally alter its rule book midway through the season, OWL officials seemed to embrace a drastic midseason change that forced players to adapt. “I think there’s a lot of traditional sports that are struggling to keep fans engaged and engage with young fans because they haven’t evolved in 100 years,” Nanzer said. “And so I think that’s an advantage that we have over traditional sports.”    The championship trophy for the first Overwatch League finals. (David ‘Dee’ Delgado/For The Washington Post)  Building on the foundation The league said it sold out the approximately 11,000 available seats for the two-day finals. Any fans searching the secondary market for tickets last week were paying at least $125 to get into the arena. DJ Khaled performed before the day’s main event and for the next 75 minutes, all eyes were glued the videoboard. Down below cameras fluttered about, zooming in tight on the players. It was all broadcast live globally on Twitch and scheduled to re-air during prime time on ESPN2. The linear broadcast deal is regarded as a big step for the young league. It not only validated esports’ place on the North American sports landscape, but it has the potential to help broaden OWL’s reach. Team executives know gamers are comfortable turning to Twitch but feel there’s also a potential audience that’s more accustomed to traditional cable. (Twitch is owned by Amazon, whose founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) “Your core fan base might not go there, but their parents and their family and friends may,” said the Fusion’s Roberts, who’s the son of Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts. It could potentially help mainstream the sport in a way where discussion isn’t relegated to online portals, college dorm rooms or school hallways. It could be discussed on sports talk radio, featured on SportsCenter and debated at the office water cooler. Its audience wouldn’t merely be those who play Overwatch themselves.

Think about it this way, nobody would say you need to play baseball in order to be a baseball fan. I believe what we’re building is kind of a social and cultural movement.” The way team and league executives see it, they jumped into a business where the market was already in place with a built-in audience that was hungry for an engaging product. And OWL officials are counting on them being around for awhile. “Have you met a 12-year old recently?” Nanzer asks. “Because if you have, I’m guessing all they do is watch other people play video games on Twitch and YouTube. And that’s not going to magically change when they turn 35. It’s not like they’re going to turn 35 and be like, ‘Well, I’m a baseball fan now.’” They hope the party inside of Barclays Saturday was just a glimpse at the future: fans filling seats, long lines at merchandise stands, a riveting competition taking place on stage. That commitment could only become more common in generations to come. “In the far away future — like 20 years from now — I don’t think there will be any non-gamers,” said Roberts. “I think kids today, they’ll have kids, and they’ll play games with their kids. It’s like who today do you know that doesn’t play any sports? Everyone at least has some familiarity. I think that’s where things are headed.” The Barclays crowd certainly knew what they were watching. They waved signs, cheered on their favorite players and were treated to an exciting finale. London entered the day having won three straight matches, including a 3-1 win on Friday. Led by 18-year old Joon-yeong Park, a damage specialist better known in the Overwatch world as “Profit,” the Spitfire won the Junkertown map, breezed through Lijiang Tower and then sealed the title by battling back and toppling the Fusion on King’s Row, a London-inspired map.

(Patrick Semansky/Associated Press)   by Emily Giambalvo July 31 at 2:42 PM Email the author   OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Lamar Jackson won a Heisman Trophy as a quarterback. He set records in his three seasons at Louisville as a quarterback. The Baltimore Ravens traded up to select Jackson in the first round of this year’s NFL draft because of his success at that position. Yet when Baltimore kicks off its preseason slate with the Hall of Fame Game against the Chicago Bears on Thursday in Canton, Ohio, Jackson will be seeking to prove the simple fact that he is indeed still a quarterback. “That’s the first thing I want to show,” said Jackson, whom some NFL teams reportedly wanted to see work out as a wide receiver. “Just show my growth from college to my new chapter in life.” [A soccer player from Norway who once had a 92-yard punt has impressed at Ravens camp] Jackson, who won the Heisman as a 19-year-old sophomore in 2016, is behind veteran mainstay Joe Flacco on Baltimore’s depth chart. Flacco has been the Ravens’ starter for the last 10 years and led the team to a Super Bowl win after the 2012 season. With Flacco, however, the Ravens have missed out on the playoffs the past three years, and Jackson represents the team’s future if he is able to adjust to the NFL game. In preparation for his Ravens debut Thursday, his first live action since the TaxSlayer Bowl in December, Jackson said he has been practicing calling plays in front of the mirror. Ravens offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg said he will be looking to see if the adjustments Jackson has made in practice translate to the game environment. Sometimes, he said, players at any position can revert to old habits once they’re in a game situation. “I’ll probably have butterflies — my first NFL game,” Jackson said. “It’s not a real game, but it counts for me. Definitely butterflies. I can’t wait. I’m really anxious.” [Johnny Manziel to make first CFL start for Montreal Alouettes on Friday] Jackson cemented himself as an electric running quarterback at Louisville. Through his three years in college, Jackson accumulated more than 4,000 yards on the ground and 50 rushing touchdowns — in addition to more than 9,000 passing yards. But in the NFL, he will have to be smarter about when he decides to take off. That’s what Ravens backup Robert Griffin III had to learn when he entered the league as a mobile quarterback with the Washington Redskins in 2012. “I feel like he’s my little brother, but I’m not going to try as the big brother to tell him don’t do this,” said Griffin, whose Redskins tenure was derailed after he suffered a major knee injury at the end of his rookie season. “He’s going to have to learn some things on his own as he’s out there and he’s working. I think he’ll figure it out pretty quickly, and he’ll still be the dynamic player that he is.” Griffin described new quarterbacks coach James Urban as someone who “doesn’t try to coach the playmaker out of you.” There are times to push for extra yards, but there are also times to just get down, Griffin said. Griffin had to fight against his competitive nature to not treat every play like it was the last one of the game. He has talked to Jackson about the quicker pace of the NFL, and Jackson will start to learn firsthand beginning Thursday. “He’s got the tools and everybody around him to help him be successful,” Griffin said. “I think he’s been great about it, with listening. We’re just trying to teach him how to be a pro.” More on the NFL: Richard Sherman says Jerry Jones has an ‘old plantation mentality’ about anthem policy Dallas sportscaster rips Jerry Jones for his anthem stance and for not following it himself Panthers DB Ross Cockrell suffers an injury so horrible you could hear it ',\n",

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Des Bieler August 1 at 10:40 AM Email the author   Rookies are eternally the shiny new objects in the NFL, but interest in them, particularly for first-round picks, is often out of proportion to their actual on-field production. By contrast, the opposite dynamic is frequently the case in fantasy football, where uncertainty over how large a role a given rookie might have and how well he might perform in it can cause him to slip in drafts. As such, rookies can present very nice draft values for those with the nerve to select them over more proven commodities. Of course, they shouldn’t be selected any higher than makes sense, so here is a guide to when drafters should think about taking the plunge on the top first-year players. For the purposes of this exercise, we’ll assume a 12-team league with PPR scoring. Running Back Saquon Barkley, Giants: First round I am on board with the real draft’s No. 2 overall pick\\xa0going as high as sixth in fantasy drafts, and possibly even higher in .5-PPR and standard formats.

[The top fantasy players helped/hurt by offseason movement] Derrius Guice, Redskins: Fourth round The hard-charging back is set for early-down and short-yardage work, with some receiving upside, in a good offense. Ronald Jones, Buccaneers: Fifth round One of the most difficult players to forecast, Jones is likely to lead a committee and offers big-play ability. Sony Michel, Patriots: Fifth round We know New England loves to use a committee at RB, and while Michel has stiff competition for touches in Rex Burkhead and James White, there should be plenty of work to go around in a Tom Brady-led attack. Rashaad Penny, Seahawks: Sixth round Ever-upbeat Pete Carroll’s effusive praise for Chris Carson is less of a concern than Seattle’s general inability to run the ball. [The top five fantasy picks are obvious, but who’s No. 6?] Royce Freeman, Broncos: Eighth round Denver appears determined to keep Devontae Booker heavily involved, with\\xa0De’Angelo Henderson and others also vying for a piece of the pie. Kerryon Johnson, Lions: 10th round Could lose goal line carries to LeGarrette Blount and receptions to Theo Riddick on a team that has long favored the pass. Nick Chubb, Browns: 11th round Might spend the year as Carlos Hyde’s understudy. Nyheim Hines, Colts: 11th round Team wants to use speedy, undersized former WR all over the field, and he could be the primary pass-catching back. Jordan Wilkins, Colts: 13th round Skepticism about Marlon Mack feeds into widespread intrigue around Wilkins. As a late-round flier, he could pay huge dividends. Wide Receiver D.J. Moore, Panthers: 11th round First WR taken in real draft has looked good in training camp but could find consistent targets hard to come by this season. Michael Gallup, Cowboys: 11th round He has a real chance to become the leading receiver amid Dallas’s threadbare WR corps. Anthony Miller, Bears: 13th round Polished prospect is ticketed for a slot role and could see useful volume. Calvin Ridley, Falcons: 13th round Some advocates might be too quick to assume he’ll immediately push past Mo Sanu. Christian Kirk, Cardinals: 15th round Hardly out of the question that he emerges as Arizona’s No. 2 receiver behind Larry Fitzgerald. Tight End Hayden Hurst, Ravens: 16th round He was a first-round pick by a Baltimore team that, with Joe Flacco, has loved to throw to TEs. Mike Gesicki, Dolphins: 16th round Elite athlete pushing for a role in a Miami offense that lost high-percentage target maven Jarvis Landry. Mark Andrews, Ravens; Dallas Goedert, Eagles:\\xa0Two bonus picks here. Both make for decent fliers in very deep leagues. [Your fantasy league would be much better with these settings] Quarterback With the depth at the position, there’s not much reason to even think about these players in single-QB leagues, but in superflex or two-QB formats they could merit some consideration, in this order:  Sam Darnold, Jets: Most likely rookie to win starting job out of training camp. Josh Allen, Bills: Next most likely, but it would be surprising if he didn’t struggle to complete half his throws. Josh Rosen, Cardinals: Sam Bradford is the starter but, of course, is major injury risk. Baker Mayfield, Browns: Backing up Tyrod Taylor for time being, despite being No. 1 overall pick. Lamar Jackson, Ravens: Running ability would make him a hot pickup if he got the chance to start.

Coming off a season in which the Rockets lead the NBA with 65 victories and pushed the Golden State Warriors to seven games in the Western Conference finals, Houston was expected to bring back largely the same team for another shot at the now two-time defending champions.

That Carter-Williams, Ennis and Anthony together have a salary cap hit of about $4.5 million — compared to the $15 million Ariza got from Phoenix and the $4.3 million Mbah a Moute received from Los Angeles — makes it hard to ignore the likelihood they weren’t retained because of luxury tax concerns alone. But when the question of whether Houston has taken a step back was posed to James Harden, the NBA’s reigning most valuable player, he didn’t hesitate: Absolutely not. “No. You can go back to articles and conversations and people said, ‘Me and Chris can’t play together.’ [Then] we were the number one [team] in the NBA,” Harden said with a laugh after Team USA practice last week. “Obviously, you can look at a roster and look at different players and say that. But you have to be on that court and you’ve got to be in the trenches and be in the war. “Eventually we will figure it out. We have enough leadership in that locker room and a great coaching staff to figure that out.” Whether the Rockets have taken a step back or not, it is obvious that if Houston is going to come anywhere near replicating the success it had last year, it’s going to have to do so in a different way. From the first day of training camp last season, the Rockets built their team around a switching defense that emphasized its ability to have anyone on the court guard anyone else at any time. It was a defense specifically wired to try to stop the Warriors — and, if Paul hadn’t blown out his hamstring in the final minute of Game 5 of the Western Conference finals, or if the Rockets hadn’t missed 27 straight three-pointers in Game 7, it might have accomplished its goal. But even if one could argue Ariza, now 33, has lost a step, or that Mbah a Moute could be a risk moving forward after dislocating his shoulder twice last season, replacing them won’t be easy. Ennis is the kind of piece of raw clay that Rockets Coach Mike D’Antoni has molded into an impact player in the past, but he’s never come close to providing the kind of impact at either end as Ariza and Mbah a Moute have. Anthony, on the other hand, is coming off a season with the Oklahoma City Thunder in which he struggled to be a third option behind Russell Westbrook and Paul George — precisely the kind of role he will be playing in Houston. And, for all of his offensive gifts, Anthony has never been known as a defensive stopper. There is a method to Houston’s madness, though — at least in the eyes of Eric Gordon, the other Rocket who was part of Team USA’s mini camp last week. It all goes back to that Game 7, and specifically Houston’s inability to make anything from deep over the final three quarters of that game. If Houston had more of an offensive spark, things could have been a lot different. “I still think we’re going to be a championship-caliber team, for sure,” Gordon said. “We did lose two dynamic guys that are really good defenders for us [Ariza and Mbah a Moute], really versatile guys. [But we] brought in guys that are also versatile, but more on the offensive side. “We’re still going to be really good. When you look at that Warriors series, we just needed a little bit more scoring a little bit. We just hit a couple more threes, it would’ve been different even with guys injured. So we’re still in good position.” The counterpoint to that is when Houston did try to deploy an offensive-first player in that Game 7 by playing Ryan Anderson in the third quarter, the Warriors promptly attacked him repeatedly, went on a quick 14-2 run and swung the game decisively in their favor. Still, the Rockets deserve the benefit of the doubt after the season they had. The same goes for General Manager Daryl Morey, who always seems to have a trick up his sleeve. One thing Houston won’t be lacking in, however, is motivation. After the way the West finals played out — with the Rockets, even without Paul, leading at halftime of both Games 6 and 7, before dropping both games — Harden said he hasn’t been able to let it go. “That was a good feeling,” Harden said of winning the league’s MVP award, “but that feeling that I had in that Western Conference finals, with basically one half to go … I need that feeling back. I’ll try to work my butt off, and mentally lock in as much as I can to get back to that feeling. “Like, you are right there. You’re a half away, and then something, just a roadblock hits you and you have to find a way to get past that roadblock. We couldn’t get past that roadblock. It was just too tough. “We’ve got to get back there.” For the next nine months or so, the focus will be on whether the moves the Rockets made this summer will allow them to — or whether Houston let its best chance at a title slip away this past season, done in by Paul’s balky hamstring and all those wayward three-pointers. Just don’t expect Harden to agree with that assessment. “What we have right now is for sure good enough,” he said. “We have to realize nothing changes for us. You’ve got to realize: that was me and Chris’s first year together. Guys were asking, ‘Can they play together? How is that going to work?’ We made it work, and it was easy. “Once training camp hits, we’ll work our butts off, and every single day we’ll just continue to get better and keep chopping away.” Read more: LeBron James: Trump has used sports ‘to divide us’ After procedures on knee and elbow, Paul George is ‘comfortable’ and looking like his old self Jerry Colangelo, one of the NBA’s elder statesmen, talks Team USA, the 76ers and more Rockets become the center of attention on final day of Team USA minicamp The contentious relationship between Kevin Durant and NBA Twitter continues Ted Leonsis projects Wizards as possibly the ‘deepest team that we’ve ever had’ ',\n",

(Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)   by Jesse Dougherty June 26 Email the author   Damon Evans walked through the line of Maryland coaches and offered each a varied greeting: a firm handshake for men’s basketball’s Mark Turgeon, a pat on the shoulder for football’s DJ Durkin, a hug for field hockey’s Missy Meharg, and so on. This was just after Evans was officially announced as Maryland’s athletic director Tuesday morning. Cameras clicked inside a ballroom of The Hotel at the University of Maryland in College Park. Each embrace included a smile and some form of congratulations. The introduction of an athletic director is usually a chance for coaches to meet the new boss, feel them out, put a face to a name they’ve been hearing for weeks. This was not that. Evans has headed the athletic department for about eight months. “You got to get to know a person to really understand who they are,” Evans said Tuesday of how his familiarity with the athletic department and search committee may have helped him get hired. “In order to do that you build those relationships. That will speak for itself. I do think that helped me out.” Maryland has not had a permanent athletic director since Kevin Anderson went on sabbatical last October. It has had the 48-year-old Evans, who filled the interim role and was officially promoted on Monday. Maryland paid Turnkey Search $120,000 to aid in the process from April 24 to Aug. 22, according to a contract obtained by The Washington Post through a public records request. The decision came just after the midway point of that initial time frame. There is skepticism among multiple high-level donors that a two-month search could organically produce a hire who’s been with the university since 2014 as Anderson’s second-in-command. But Maryland President Wallace D. Loh, as well as two members of an internal search committee, repeatedly expressed that Evans is the “right person at the right time” for an athletic department facing a number of challenges. “It was an open and national search,” Loh said Tuesday to emphasize that Evans was not grandfathered into the job without an extensive competition. Loh added that Maryland interviewed six candidates for the opening, though he did not specify who they were beyond\\xa0Evans and two other previously reported candidates, Temple Athletic Director Patrick Kraft and former Tennessee AD John Currie. “That is just the way it turned out,” Loh continued after saying that approximately two-thirds of the major searches he’s conducted as president have led to outside hires. “I think anyone who is taking a major, senior role has to compete against everybody who qualifies. And the fact is that [Evans] may have an advantage because he’s well-known, but very often in academia, people don’t hire from the inside, they hire from the outside because there is too much baggage [with the internal candidate] if they have made tough decisions.” Evans is not free of baggage, from both before and during his time at Maryland. In 2004, he was named athletic director at University of Georgia, where he played wide receiver from 1988 to 1991. That made him the first African American athletic director in Southeastern Conference history. He held that role until 2010, when he resigned following a DUI arrest and started a four-year run in the private sector. Anderson — who officially resigned as Maryland’s athletic director in April and is now the interim AD at Cal State-Northridge — gave Evans a second chance in 2014. Maryland’s latest issue is the death of football player Jordan McNair. McNair was rushed to the hospital following an organized team workout on May 29 and died on June 13. The cause of his death has not been announced. He was 19. Multiple people with knowledge of the hiring process believed McNair’s death hurt Evans’s chances of being named athletic director. But two of those people also thought Evans’s familiarity with the ongoing internal and external reviews into McNair’s death made him fit to guide Maryland through them. When asked why the university did not wait until the conclusion of the external review to name a new AD, Loh said: “I don’t know how long that review is going to take. They are bringing in an outside reviewer and so on, and that may take a while.” The university said on June 19 that the external review, which started at the end of last week, “could take up to 90 days.” It also believed by a number of people with knowledge of the hiring process that Evans has had Loh’s support since Anderson departed. Loh did not deny that Tuesday, but insisted that Evans, a skilled public speaker and noted fundraiser, won an open competition. “I think somebody from the inside has a higher hurdle to surmount,” Loh said, and now it is Evans’s job to help Maryland jump over a bunch more.

The contract, obtained by The Washington Post through a public records request, runs from July 2 to June 30, 2024. It carries a base annual salary of $600,000. Evans will also be paid $120,000 of supplemental annual income for media appearances, his participation in Maryland’s apparel deals, and for making promotional and fundraising appearances on behalf of the university. Maryland will receive all revenue generated by any of the activities tied to Evans’s supplemental income, according to the contract, the $120,000 will be paid in equal installments on Dec. 1 and June 1 of each contract year. Evans then has the opportunity to make up to $45,000 in annual bonuses. Fundraising, one of his noted skills as an administrator, can make him $15,000 in bonuses. He will be paid an additional $7,500 at the end of each year in which the “number of Terrapin Club memberships has exceeded the previous year’s total by 5 percent,” according to the contract.\\xa0 The Terrapin Club is made up of athletic department donors. Evans can also be paid an additional $7,500 in fundraising bonuses for each year in which total athletic department donations exceed the previous year’s total by 5 percent or more. The rest of the potential bonuses are tied to athletic performance. The annual Directors Cup competition ranks colleges based on their aggregate success across athletic programs. The higher Maryland finishes in the final standings, the more money Evans can make as a result: $25,000 if Maryland ranks between first and fifth; $15,000 if it ranks between sixth and 10th; $10,000 if it ranks between 11th and 20th; and $5,000 if it ranks between 21st and 30th. Lastly, Evans will make an additional $5,000 at the end of each year Maryland has 10 or more teams play in NCAA-sanctioned postseason competition. If Evans were terminated without cause before June 30, 2019 (the end of the first year of his contract), Maryland would face a $5 million buyout. If he were terminated without cause on July 1, 2019, or anytime thereafter, he will continue to collect his base salary for the remainder of his initial contract term. Evans resigned as the athletic director at the University of Georgia in July of 2010 following a DUI arrest. Maryland is hoping Evans is a stabilizing presence in a trying time for the athletic department. Evans was Maryland’s interim athletic director after Kevin Anderson went on sabbatical last October, and was officially named full-time athletic director eight months later, in part because he is familiar with the challenges that lie ahead. The university is conducting an external review following the June 13 death of sophomore football player Jordan McNair, who was hospitalized following an organized team workout on May 29. The review started at the end of the third week in June and could take up to 90 days to complete, according to the university. The review includes an independent evaluation, conducted by the athletic training consulting firm Walters Inc., of Maryland’s “planning and conducting team conditioning and practice sessions; and for responding to health emergencies during or after those sessions.” The university also recently released two subpoenas it received from a federal grand jury in New York in conjunction with the Department of Justice’s probe into college basketball. Then there are the usual athletic director challenges — filling out his staff, fundraising for the school’s new indoor football facility, athletic performance — that Evans will have to juggle as he moves closer to his first academic year in charge.

McNair died June 13 at 19 years old. Maryland declined to provide McNair’s cause of death at a news conference June 14, citing respect for the privacy of McNair’s family. The school is participating in an external review of the situation conducted by Walters Inc., an athletic training consulting firm. The review is evaluating Maryland’s procedures and protocols related to McNair’s death. It is also evaluating the football program’s procedures and protocols related to “planning and conducting team conditioning and practice sessions; and for responding to health emergencies during or after those sessions,” according to a university spokesman. The review started at the end of the third week in June, and a university spokeswoman said then that it could require up to 90 days. The Jordan McNair Foundation, started by McNair’s parents, Tonya Wilson and Martin McNair, aims to “promote awareness, educate, and advocate for parents and student athletes about heat-related illnesses at youth, high school, and collegiate levels,” according to the “Our Mission” page of the website. The site includes an essay written by Martin McNair titled, “Jordan’s Journey: A Letter From a Father.” “Our plans did not include his death. Our plans included something more. Our plans included him,” Martin McNair wrote after detailing his son’s path to becoming a highly sought-after Division I football recruit out of Randallstown, Md., and eventually an offensive lineman for the Terrapins. “But God had other plans. Jordan gave us 19 great years, and we will miss him. He was a great son, grandson, cousin, nephew, brother, friend, student, roommate and teammate.” “While Jordan is not with us to build his legacy, as a family we are doing it for him. This is his legacy,” Martin McNair continued in the essay. “We ask but one thing, that you join us in keeping Jordan’s name and legacy alive by supporting The Jordan McNair Foundation (T.J.M.F.).” McNair was hospitalized following a team workout May 29 at the program’s outdoor practice facility. The workout was designed and supervised by the Maryland strength and conditioning staff, and certified athletic trainers were present throughout, according to an account provided by the university. Maryland Coach DJ Durkin was also at the workout, which began around 4:15 p.m. McNair, who was listed as 6-foot-4 and 325 pounds, had trouble recovering after completing a series of 110-yard sprints, a standard conditioning test, and received medical attention. McNair soon was transported to the team’s practice facility and later airlifted to\\xa0R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore at approximately 6 p.m., according to the university’s timeline of that day. He received a liver transplant, according to a GoFundMe page created June 6 to support his family. He died 15 days after he was initially hospitalized. The foundation’s website lists three programs: “Breaking Chains/the Jordan McNair Training Facility,” “The Jordan McNair Scholarship Fund,” and “My Body, My Safety: Player Safety 101.” The third program is looking to educate athletes, parents and coaches on heat-related illnesses in a handful of ways. One way is to “Educate students on heat-related illnesses and the stages of heatstroke.” Another is to “Partner with medical professionals to educate student athletes about their bodies and how to know when enough is enough.” Read more Maryland coverage: Many questions remain unanswered in death of Maryland player Jordan McNair Maryland basketball subpoenaed in college basketball corruption probe Damon Evans takes over as Maryland athletic director after two-month search led back to him Maryland Athletic Director Damon Evans will make $720,000 a year, before bonuses ',\n",

(Annie Rice/AP)  CHICAGO — Before DJ Durkin discussed the upcoming season, a brewing quarterback competition and the benefit of recruiting local talent, the Maryland coach squinted into a row of bright lights, held both sides of a glass lectern and addressed what is heavily weighing on his football program as a new campaign nears. “Good to be here this morning. Good to see everyone. Marks the start of a new season. Great day. Appreciate you being here,” Durkin said to start his opening remarks at Big Ten media days Tuesday. Then he took a deep breath, arched his eyebrows and spoke a little softer than before. “I’d like for us to talk about the upcoming season, but just take a moment to share some thoughts on Jordan McNair and what he meant to our program, the type of teammate he was,” Durkin continued, referencing the Maryland offensive lineman who died June 13, two weeks after he was hospitalized following an organized team workout. “Obviously the loss of Jordan has been a tremendously difficult thing for our entire program to deal with this summer.” Durkin stood in front of a couple hundred reporters inside a Marriott conference room in downtown Chicago. Next will come the Terrapins’ first day of training camp at the end of next week, then their season opener against Texas at FedEx Field on Sept. 1, then their home opener two weeks later. All of that, like Tuesday, will carry the sadness and unease of McNair’s death. [Scott Frost is ready to get Nebraska ‘back where it belongs’] Earlier this month, McNair’s family announced that the 19-year-old lineman’s death was caused by heatstroke. They have also hired the law firm that represented the family of Freddie Gray, the Baltimore man who died in 2015 after being injured while in police custody, and are exploring their legal options. Durkin, who was at the workout with the rest of the Maryland coaching staff, declined to provide further details of that day while Maryland is still participating in an external review. The external review opened in the third week of June and could last 60 more days, according to a timeline provided by a university spokeswoman when it began. The review is being conducted by Walters Inc., an athletic training consulting firm. In addition to looking into McNair’s death, the review is evaluating\\xa0the football program’s procedures and protocols related to “planning and conducting team conditioning and practice sessions; and for responding to health emergencies during or after those sessions.” Durkin said Tuesday that he and Terrapins coaches and players have not yet been interviewed as part of the review but that Walters Inc. has made a list of people with whom to speak. Durkin did say that Maryland has already made adjustments in response to what led to McNair’s hospitalization May 29. “There’s things that we immediately put into place and looked at,” Durkin said Tuesday. “And then obviously through our external review there will be things long-term-wise that we’ll continue to change and adapt to.” “Just being more cognizant of all the things we are doing with our guys,” he said when asked what specific changes have been made so far. “Being aware of their hydration levels, being aware of communicating out on the field, all those things we’ve looked at and we made adjustments already with that. We’ll continue to make adjustments.” Maryland has offered a loose timeline of the day McNair was hospitalized and said the workout was designed and supervised by the team’s strength and conditioning staff. The university has also noted that athletic trainers were present throughout. The workout began at about 4:15 p.m. with the temperature around 80 degrees, according to the university. An initial 911 call was made at 5:57, according to an incident report written by Prince George’s County medical responders and obtained by The Washington Post through a public records request. That call, made by an unidentified man, indicated that McNair was “hyperventilating,” and the university has said McNair had trouble recovering from a conditioning test consisting of a series of 110-yard sprints. Medical responders arrived five minutes after the initial call. A second call at 6:07 p.m. indicated that McNair might have been having a seizure, a known symptom of heatstroke. McNair arrived at Washington Adventist Hospital in nearby Takoma Park at 6:36 p.m. and was airlifted to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore that night. He died 15 days later. “It’s definitely tough going into camp with what happened to Jordan,” Maryland offensive tackle Derwin Gray said Tuesday. “I don’t really want to get too detailed into what happened and things like that, but Jordan was a great guy. Jordan was a big guy with a big heart, and he loved to smile. He came to work every day, never complained, and I feel like he left a great message to us without even saying it: Hang around your teammates. Smile. Enjoy what you do together. “And most importantly, whether it’s a coach to a player, or player to player, or coach to coach, just telling each other, ‘I love you.’ Because you never know with this game we’re playing, anything can happen. So that’s what I take from the situation.” Now the Maryland football team\\xa0is deciding how to best honor McNair this season, and Durkin said Tuesday that a group of players is leading that discussion. “Jordan and his family will always be part of what we do,” Durkin said. “We’ve assigned a player committee to head that up and make sure that there’s always a presence. We’re a team playing for Jordan this year. So there will be some things we’ll announce in the coming days as we get into the season of what exactly we’re going to do and how we’re going to handle that.” More college sports coverage from The Post: UNC’s Larry Fedora, who questioned football’s link with CTE, finds backers at Fox Sports and Yahoo Brewer: Fedora’s defensive crouch is as dangerous to football’s future as concussions At ACC media days, Louisville football addresses latest scandal involving athletic department ',\n",

(Photo by Bob DeChiara/USA Today Sports)   by Candace Buckner July 27 Email the author   During the Washington Wizards’ first game of the Eastern Conference playoffs, Bradley Beal noticed a trend. The Toronto Raptors were alternating defenses when Beal operated as the ballhandler in pick-and-roll plays. They committed, switched and sometimes threw a hard hedge — when the defender on the screener jumps out on the ballhandler to slow down the action. After the Wizards lost Game 1, Beal sought a solution to Toronto’s tactics. “They did a good job of it, but I watched film,” Beal said April 17, the morning before Game 2, “and I think I got some counters that will beat their defenses.” He didn’t. As the Wizards’ ballhandlers tried to create basketball poetry, operating around the occasional hard pick mixed with too many halfhearted screens, the play was perforated as Washington fell into a two-game deficit. Enter one\\xa0of the most active roll men in the NBA. While many have dissected the Wizards’ decision to add Dwight Howard, who was traded from the Charlotte Hornets to the Brooklyn Nets, then negotiated a buyout to become a free agent, his new teammates can focus on the big man’s particular skill set. On a purely basketball front, a healthy Howard may cure Washington’s weaknesses in the pick and roll and improve any blind spots on the fast break. “Some of the narrative is out there that I heard, but I’m not concerned with it,” Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said Monday after Howard was officially introduced. “My focus is on him and what we’ve talked about and our relationship, what we’ll establish going forward.” [Wizards deleted Team USA photo of John Wall but couldn’t stop him from getting roasted] Last season, when the Wizards had a ballhandler blossoming in confidence in Beal; a big man willing to sacrifice his body for screens in Marcin Gortat; and, for only 41 games, the services of a five-time point guard deft in finding teammates in John Wall, the team often relied\\xa0on the pick and roll to create offense. Despite having personnel suited for the play, the Wizards were surprisingly inefficient as a pick-and-roll team. Washington\\xa0ranked below average in plays produced from the pick-and-roll ballhandler, 0.82 points per possession for 19th overall, according to NBA Advanced Stats. And even though Gortat finished fourth in the league in screen assists, the team recorded just 0.98 points per possession (27th in the league) when the action went to the roll man. The bread-and-butter play starts, naturally, with a pick and is designed to create an open shot for the ballhandler or a pass to the cutting screener. The Wizards, however, sometimes found the simple play more difficult, just as Beal experienced in Game 1 against the Raptors. On that night, Beal, who led the team with 510 possessions as the pick-and-roll ballhandler in 2017-18 according to Synergy Sports, often faced an extra defender after a teammate slipped the screen. Although that’s common in the NBA, a hard screen initiates the action, and the threat of the screener finishing near the rim is more likely to keep a defender from hedging the ballhandler. Gortat did not pose such a threat — he made only 45.5 percent of his shots on plays in which he rolled to the basket. Conversely, Howard shot 58.4 percent on the same plays last season for Charlotte. “He’s still athletic,” Wall said about Howard. “Look what he did last year: He averaged 16 and 12. He’s a guy who can still catch lobs and dunk the ball under the basket.” Still, Howard’s work as a roll man graded out as average on Synergy’s rating system. He performed better, however, in transition. The statistical website separately evaluated both Howard and the Wizards as excellent on transition plays, and Brooks already can envision how the big man would be most effective when the team elects to get out and run. [Dwight Howard has been the star of the show. With the Wizards, he’ll be part of the chorus.] “We want to play fast. How do you play fast? You don’t play fast by getting the ball … out through the net,” Brooks said. “You’ve got to get it off the rim and get out and run. He’s the best rebounder in the league, and to be able to do that, it creates offense for our guys that can play fast, that can shoot.” Howard averaged 12.5 rebounds, ranking third in the NBA behind Andre Drummond (16.0) and DeAndre Jordan (15.2), but even when he wasn’t concluding a defensive possession by securing the ball, the 265-pounder still hurried down the floor fast enough to finish many of Charlotte’s breaks. Howard completed 36 of 51 shot attempts in transition (nearly 71 percent) and drew free throws on 26.6 percent of those possessions. On the day of Game 2 between the Wizards and Raptors, Howard was busy in Charlotte holding a Jr. NBA clinic at the Dwight Howard Boys & Girls Club. Howard had missed the playoffs for only the fourth time in his 14-year career, and the Wizards were missing someone with his skills as an efficient roll man and transition scorer. Two months later, after Howard was dealt by the Hornets, he received an Instagram direct message from Wall asking whether he wanted to play in Washington. He said yes. The big man looking for a home found one with a team that needs a pick-and-roll boost. “I think we are going to really just shock a lot of people, and I think for me, the rest of this team and this organization, it’s all about winning. That is our mind-set,” Howard said. “That is the only thing that us as players have been talking about, myself, coach and also Ernie [Grunfeld, the general manager], how we are excited about turning things around here in D.C.” Read more from Post Sports: Alex Smith was a safe choice.

Washington finished 43-39, earning six fewer wins than it had the previous year, and advanced to the playoffs as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards lost in the first round to the top-seeded Toronto Raptors in six games. In the owner’s view, the offseason renovations should make Washington a force in the East. “If you look at this roster for the Wizards, I think it’s as deep or the deepest team that we’ve ever had,” Leonsis said. “I think that the East will be very competitive, but I don’t think we should be overlooked. I think we’re going to have a really good team this year.” Leonsis, speaking after his Monumental Sports & Entertainment group announced a practice-facility naming-rights partnership with MedStar, said the Wizards addressed specific areas of concern. The Howard signing filled the hole in the middle after the team shipped center Marcin Gortat to the Los Angeles Clippers for Rivers. During his 14-year career, Howard has averaged 17.4 points, 12.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game, and he comes to Washington with the practical price tag of $5.3 million. While Howard, 32, should be an improvement on the older Gortat, he still brings baggage. In consecutive summers, Howard has been dumped by his two previous teams, and over time he has taken blows to his reputation. [Dwight Howard could provide a pick-me-up in the Wizards’ most used play] “I think that’s a media-generated issue. I don’t think it’s a basketball-related issue,” Leonsis said about Howard. “He could’ve signed in many, many places, and really it all comes down to the salary cap. Dwight is paid like a max player. We’re paying him the mid-level exception. He will be a great addition to the team, he wants to be here, and his skill set is what we needed: someone who could run, play defense and rebound. And he’s at the time of his career right now where he’s been paid a lot of money; he’s still getting paid max money [with] the buyout and what we’re paying him. … So, at that price, I think he was the greatest addition we could add at that position.” Although the Wizards lost a bench scorer in Mike Scott, who had the third-highest three-point shooting percentage on the team last year, Leonsis has confidence in veteran reserves Green and Rivers. When asked to evaluate the summer, Leonsis, who also owns the Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals, compared the Wizards to his more successful team. “I thought both front offices had ‘A’ grades for their offseason. I think that when a season ends, you sit down and say, ‘This is what we want to accomplish,’ and for the Wizards, it was we need to have more balance and more depth and be prepared for injuries,” Leonsis said. “We had injuries last year and we want to be able to have interchangeable parts and players that are adapted to the new NBA. “From center position to wing to the backcourt,” Leonsis continued. “So we were able to bring in a lot of bench scoring, and I think we can go 10 to 11 players deep.” Read more: Wizards deleted Team USA photo of John Wall but couldn’t stop him from getting roasted Jerry Colangelo, one of the NBA’s elder statesmen, talks Team USA, the 76ers and more Dwight Howard has been the star of the show.

He peered through black-rimmed glasses and gripped a microphone as he spoke. It looked like a pencil in his big, basketball hands.  “In closing, thank you so much,” James said. “We love you!” the crowd shouted. “I love you, too,” he replied. “I really do. I really do.” And when the cheers softened, The Kid From Akron ended a day in which he strengthened his commitment to his hometown by doing something seemingly contradictory. He said goodbye. “And know, no matter if I’m playing in Los Angeles or not, Akron, Ohio, is always home for me,” James said. “Always.” James called Monday perhaps the greatest day of his life. He celebrated the opening of the I Promise School, the offspring of an enterprising partnership between his foundation and Akron Public Schools that intends to change the lives of some of the city’s most underprivileged children. But this was also his first public appearance since he left the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Los Angeles Lakers in early July. And so if this was the greatest day of his life, he also admitted it was bittersweet. “On one hand, I’m opening up a school where I would love to be here every single day when my schedule permits,” James said late Monday afternoon, standing in a classroom in the stunning facility. “And then on the other hand, I’m starting a new journey in my life where I’m on the other coast. But when you have the support system and you have the people around you that’s helped you along the way, you know you never travel alone. So it makes the transition easier.” [As LeBron James heads west, can the once-great Lakers rise to his level?] James is moving away. And he is staying forever. In his world, this is neither contradictory nor unorthodox. He doesn’t feel the need to choose. He can be King James and The Kid from Akron. He can live in just one place, but his impact can be ubiquitous. He can satisfy his worldly curiosity while keeping his promise to uplift his home region. As James’s two passions clashed on this day, it was also clear what allows them to operate jointly: ambition. Whatever the persona or pursuit, it is ambition that makes James the quintessential American sports superstar. In everything he does, he refuses to settle, and he dreams a little differently. So it figures he would be the fish that wants to swim in the small and big pond simultaneously. On Monday, he made history at home and fantasized about adding to the tradition of the Lakers, one of the NBA’s historic superpowers. “There’s no reason you should become a Laker, become a Yankee, become part of Man U, become part of some franchise or clubs like that, and you don’t think about winning championships or winning at the highest level,” James said. “That’s what the history is all about.” But for the most part, James kept his reasoning for signing with the Lakers understated. He talked a little about it to appease the media, which he thanked for coming to Akron to cover the school opening. But he was adamant about focusing on the I Promise School. When James returned to the Cavaliers four years ago, he was intent on fulfilling a promise. He wanted to deliver a championship, which he did in the most dramatic manner possible in 2016, upsetting the 73-win Golden State Warriors after falling behind 3-1 in the NBA Finals. But he also wanted to make more of a difference at home. A few years ago, James was brainstorming with Michele Campbell, the executive director of the LeBron James Family Foundation. They were talking about making an even greater impact. In 2011, the foundation established its I Promise program, taking on a class of third graders and giving them the resources, incentives and support — academically and emotionally — to thrive. Campbell’s idea for a school was the extension of that concept. She thought she was just thinking out loud — couldn’t we help more kids and families with an entire school? — but James reacted seriously. “Well, why aren’t you doing that then?” James said, according to Campbell. The I Promise School has begun with 240 students, 120 each in the third and fourth grades. The plan is to expand gradually and serve students from kindergarten to eighth grade by 2022. The students being served have dire academic and emotional needs. They are some of the lowest-performing students in the district. The mission is to turn around the children’s academic lives by changing the lives of everyone in their families. The school provides services to assist children dealing with trauma and to support and educate parents trying to survive poverty. At the school, there are opportunities for parents who didn’t graduate high school to study for their GEDs. There is a pantry with donations from a food bank, and parents can pick up groceries to take home and prepare meals. They call this approach “family wraparound support.” “I think the missing link in public education is that family wraparound support,” Principal Brandi Davis said. “Because our students come to school, and they’re worried about things at home. It could be a wealth of issues going on at home. Just to know when I drop my child off at school I can go down the hallway to the family resource center and get the support I need, that just takes so much off of a parent, so much off of a child. And that’s what that trauma-informed support is all about. We want to create that safe, that secure and that caring and loving environment for our families and our students so that our kids can focus on education. And that’s what we’re all about.” This is James’s vision, right down to having 240 bicycles available so that every student has a free bike to ride. As a child, James found freedom on his bike. It helped him flee his dangerous neighborhood and venture to the parts of the city where he could play basketball, engage in productive activities and allow the community to help him. The thoughtfulness of James and his mother, Gloria, is evident in the school. They were able to turn their past pain into a crystallized understanding of what impoverished families need. James can recall missing 83 days of school as a fourth grader and being in danger of becoming “a statistic” before members of the community helped him. “School didn’t mean anything, obviously, back then,” James said of himself. “It was a surprise to me when I woke up and I was actually going to school. A lot of empty days, a lot of empty nights.” Look at him now. He’s a superstar of superstars. He knows he’s special, but he also thinks he’s lucky. He encountered people who cared, and they put him on the right path. Then basketball took his life to another level. “That’s what kids want to know, ‘Do you care about me?’\\u2009” James said. “And we do here.” The goal for the I Promise School is the same as the rest of James’s goals: Be great. The challenge is tremendous, but with one tour of the school, you can see clearly that the investment is serious. From the moment you walk in and see 114 of James’s game-worn shoes hanging from the walls in decorative fashion, you think about what dreamers can do with proper support. “Limitation is not in my vocabulary,” Davis said. “There’s always a way to get around. Working with the LeBron James Family Foundation, they have truly removed all barriers in more ways than one.” As James departs for Los Angeles, perhaps for good, he leaves behind a legacy that will outlast him. Monday was incredible — and bittersweet. But if this school lives up to its promise, time will erase any conflicted feelings. King James is moving away. The spirit of The Kid from Akron is staying forever.

And even then, it wasn’t actually over, as a last-second deal — the Baltimore Orioles capping their summer fire sale by sending second baseman Jonathan Schoop to the Milwaukee Brewers — wasn’t made official until minutes after the 4 p.m. deadline. At the end of a frantic, frenzied day, which itself came at the end of a busy month of dealmaking, the competitive landscape had been remade across both leagues, as the 2018 season enters its final two months. Some of the biggest trades of the entire summer came in the final hours leading up to the deadline, with five former all-star players dealt in the two hours leading up to the deadline. Along with Schoop, who joins a crowded infield picture in Milwaukee, those all-stars were Washington Nationals closer Brandon Kintzler, who went to the Chicago Cubs in a curious move by the third-place team in the NL East; former Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos, who went from the Tampa Bay Rays to the Philadelphia Phillies despite currently residing on the disabled list; second baseman Brian Dozier going from the Minnesota Twins to the Los Angeles Dodgers; and right-handed starter Chris Archer going from the Rays to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Fueled by a healthy dose of pennant races — four divisions saw their first- and second-place teams separated by three or fewer games entering Tuesday, and both leagues’ wild-card races are free-for-alls — as well as an extreme case of stratification, with a relatively equal number of horrendous teams eager to sell and superteams eager to buy, this year’s trade market was active, robust and fruitful. All told, each of baseball’s 30 teams made moves during the month of July. No, Bryce Harper wasn’t traded, despite a rush of rumors that he might be. But among those who were traded in the weeks, days and hours leading up to Tuesday were a World Series most valuable player (lefty Cole Hamels, sent from the Texas Rangers to the Chicago Cubs) and a four-time all-star considered among the half-dozen or so best young players in the game (Manny Machado, from the Orioles to the Dodgers).    The Nationals’ trade of Brandon Kintzler qualified as a bit of a head-scratcher. (Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)  The Phillies got a catcher (Ramos) who is on the disabled list for at least a few more weeks, and the Braves got a reliever (former all-star Darren O’Day of the Orioles) who is out for the rest of this season, while the Houston Astros got a closer (Roberto Osuna from Toronto) who is still serving a 75-game suspension for violating the league’s domestic violence policy. [In Roberto Osuna, the Astros acquire an all-star closer — and an ongoing domestic violence case] Teams that looked like certain sellers a month ago (the Pirates) suddenly became aggressive buyers, while teams that looked like firm buyers a month ago (the Nationals) suddenly became tentative sellers. “It’s not about sending messages,” Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle, whose team recently ran off 11 straight wins to alter its trajectory, told reporters in Pittsburgh. “That, I think, is the most overrated term you can use in baseball. It gives us a better opportunity to deliver, and that’s what everyone is looking for — the fans, us, everybody.” Plenty of top prospects were dealt for veterans, of course, the best of them arguably being catcher/outfielder Francisco Mejia, rated 21st on MLB Pipeline’s list of the game’s top 100 prospects, whom the Cleveland Indians sent to San Diego in exchange for relievers Brad Hand and Adam Cimber. To no one’s surprise, the players most in demand, and most frequently dealt, were relief pitchers — a reality that underscored their growing importance across the game, especially in the crucible of the postseason. Nearly every contending team — the Yankees, Phillies, Indians, Pirates, Mariners, Astros, Braves, Brewers, Diamondbacks, A’s, Cubs, Rockies and Dodgers — made moves to bolster their bullpens in July. Basically, that’s every contending team except the Nationals, who added Kelvin Herrera in June, and the Red Sox, whose acquisition of starting pitcher Nathan Eovaldi will result in someone being moved to their bullpen. For the Nationals, who passed on an opportunity to sell off other pieces and retool for 2019, their task of trying to climb back into the playoff race was made tougher by the fact the teams they will need to vanquish in August and September, not to mention October, all got significantly better at the deadline. The Phillies, who entered Tuesday with a half-game lead over the Braves, got one of the best-hitting catchers in the game in Ramos (despite his present unavailability) and a lefty reliever in Aaron Loup from the Blue Jays, to go along with infielder Asdrubal Cabrera, whom they acquired from the Mets on Friday. The Braves, meanwhile, added a controllable starting pitcher (Kevin Gausman), a slugger (Adam Duvall) and plenty of bullpen help (O’Day, Brad Brach and Jonny Venters). But while the NL playoff picture is still wide open, with as many as 10 teams that consider themselves still alive, the AL is a different story. In the aftermath of Tuesday’s trade deadline, only six of its 15 teams — the Red Sox, Yankees, Indians, Astros, Mariners and A’s — are still competing in 2018, a sad commentary on baseball’s state of stratification. No team was a more aggressive seller than the Orioles, who, saddled with the game’s worst record, wound up dealing away six pieces of their core — Machado, Gausman, Schoop, O’Day, Brach and Zach Britton — for a total of 15 younger players, all but one of them minor leaguers, and international bonus-pool money. Now that the nonwaiver trade deadline has passed, August will be at least partly consumed with the second trade deadline, for which the involved players must clear waivers before being dealt. Players must be acquired by Aug.\\xa031 to be eligible for postseason rosters. Eleven months ago, the Astros acquired Detroit Tigers ace Justin Verlander with just minutes to go before the calendar flipped to September, a fateful move that paid off in a World Series victory that probably would not have been possible without Verlander. There probably won’t be anybody like Verlander available this August, but then again, few saw that trade happening in the days leading up to it. And there’s a good chance that whoever wins this year’s World Series may have already acquired their game-changer.

A ball pinged off an aluminum bat, then thudded into a glove. And then delirium — hats in the air, gloves tossed to the side, hugs all around. “It’s honestly overwhelming,” said Keith Barnes, the president of the Mamie Johnson Little League. “My heart,” said Charlie Sperduto, who directs the baseball and softball programs at the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, “it’s never been fuller than it was last night.” The transactional information isn’t mind-blowing: Mamie Johnson beat Capitol Hill to win the District’s Little League championship. The tournament has been held annually for 31 years. Someone has to win it. Next stop for the 12 boys from Mamie Johnson: Bristol, Conn., for regionals, with the Little League World Series in sight beyond that. That result, though, is enormously important not just for those kids and coaches but for baseball in Washington and beyond, too. This is the first all-African American team to win this tournament. Think about that and then listen to Barnes, who played high school and college ball — and wants other kids like him to one day say the same. “I got tired of reading articles about the decline of African Americans in baseball,” he said Wednesday morning. “And no one had solutions.”    Next stop for the 12 boys from Mamie Johnson: Bristol, Conn., for regionals, with the Little League World Series in sight beyond that. (Mamie Johnson Little League/Mamie Johnson Little League)  Guess what? He’s now part of the solution. This shouldn’t be happening. Not yet anyway. Five years ago, there was no Little League program in the District’s Ward 7, which is almost entirely east of the Anacostia River. Five years ago, the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy hadn’t opened its gleaming facility in the heart of that ward. Five years ago, baseball not only had almost no participation here, it really had no presence. “People were interested, but they didn’t really know how to cheer at a baseball game or how to act or where to stand,” said Raphael Lockett, who is in his third year coaching with Mamie Johnson and served as the head coach for the new champs, made up of 11- and 12-year-olds. “They called umpires ‘refs,’ stuff like that. Now they’re telling me, ‘Hey, Coach, why don’t you hit-and-run here?’ They’re going through situational baseball. They’re all into it, lights out.” Major League Baseball, you need to pay attention to what happened here Tuesday night. The Major League Baseball Players Association? Yep, you too. This isn’t just about one group of kids who won one tournament over one week. This is about the future of the sport. And it’s not about rolling out some bats and balls and saying, “Look! We’re supporting baseball in inner cities!” This is about a community-wide commitment to use baseball not just for baseball’s sake but to develop youth that might not otherwise be developed. In the short-term, the kids benefit from baseball. Years from now, baseball could be the beneficiary. “We have to fill the funnel,” said Tal Alter, the only executive director in Nationals Academy history and the character whose vision and commitment made a scene such as Tuesday night’s possible.    “It’s honestly overwhelming,” said Keith Barnes, the president of the Mamie Johnson Little League, said of the squad’s title. (Mamie Johnson Little League/Mamie Johnson Little League)  Alter and his staff are trying to fill that funnel with a fire hose. There are 700 kids in the academy’s “YBA Play” program, which provides fast-paced, nontraditional entry points in the sport that have helped kids get hooked. Eight of the 12 players on the Mamie Johnson team are academy kids, coming for holistic education programs after school during the academic year — STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and literacy education but baseball as well — and then spending their summer days at the facility. “They’re in that baseball culture like every day,” Barnes said. “That made it easier from those kids to buy in to what we’re doing.” What they’re doing — together — is saving a sport in the city. Barnes used the academy as ground zero to start his league from scratch, even though he has no kids of his own and wouldn’t be paid a dime. They started with 120 kids in 2015. This year, 310 registered. Barnes and his founding partners named the league in honor of Mamie “Peanut” Johnson, the first female pitcher to play in the Negro Leagues who happened to reside in Washington. It was a nod to history. But they were thinking of the generation to come. “When I watched baseball, I didn’t really understand it,” said 12-year-old Josh Young, the team cutup. “But I wanted to try it, to try and figure it out.” That became part of the mission for Alter, Sperduto and the academy staff. Sperduto teaches fundamentals by modifying rules, trying to suck kids into the sport. To fill the funnel, they need kids such as Solomon McKinney. Two years ago, he was obsessed with basketball and had never put on a baseball glove. On Tuesday night in the championship game, he tripled off the outfield fence. “He went from bouncing the ball,” Sperduto said, “to pounding the mitt.” But it isn’t just the pulls of basketball and football — or even video games and iPhones — that they’re battling. It’s the circumstances of their section of the city. “We’ve had setbacks after setbacks,” said Sperduto, a former college baseball player who has been with the academy since before the facility opened its doors. “Some kids have moved out, and we’ve lost some kids who had great potential because of family challenges. But our team here is relentlessly positive. We believe.” Package all that up, and there’s a chance for something special to happen not only for these families and these kids when they take the field again Aug. 5. This can be a model for other major league teams to use their brand and their brawn to reignite the sport in areas where, we have been told over and over, it’s dying. In 2017, African Americans made up just 7.1 percent of MLB’s Opening Day roster spots — the lowest percentage since 1958. (The figure jumped to 7.8 percent this year.) This is a socioeconomic problem because baseball is expensive and has become a white, suburban sport. The Youth Development Foundation sponsored by MLB and the players’ union believes enough in what the Nationals Academy is doing that it gave it $1\\xa0million over three years. But is that intractable? For the championship game, the academy’s rooftop was littered with tents that shielded an overflow crowd from the showers. The sidewalks were packed. Fans sat on the hills behind the outfield walls. They brought noise makers. Supporters from other leagues around the city came to see whether Mamie Johnson could pull it off. “That’s the biggest crowd I’ve ever seen,” said Langston Speed, also 12 and a middle infielder. Just that scene matters. Since Mamie Johnson formed, since the academy opened, a critical mass of kids has shown that there’s an appetite for baseball in just the kind of neighborhood where it had seemed to dry up. But winning? Winning matters, too. Last year, some of the Mamie Johnson kids were part of a team that lost in the D.C. final, blowing a four-run lead in the final inning. Johnson herself was there to see it. “Our guys came to the moment,” Lockett said, “and it was too much.” Over the winter, Johnson died at 82. So on Tuesday night, the kids from her namesake Little League began the most important game of their young lives by cheering, “For Mamie!” They wear little peanut patches on their uniforms. And this year, they won. The foundation is there. If it’s to grow, the result mattered. “We’ve had young kids already come up, parents already come up, from 5 to 7 years old saying, ‘I want to be that team. What can we do? Where’s the league sign-up? How can we play?’” Lockett said. “ ‘How can I play with my kids? What drills are you working on?’ It’s not, ‘Where’s the basketball goal?’ It’s, ‘Can I buy a bat for next year? What are the standards?’ It’s all changing.” Forget, then, any frustration with the Nationals’ losing record at the moment. Baseball — baseball at its best — is alive in the District. Alive and growing.  For more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.

They had just smashed the New York Mets to pieces less than 12 hours earlier, a blowout featuring all sorts of franchise records, but another cloud, the latest in a 72-hour storm front, was hanging over the locker Shawn Kelley had occupied for nearly three full seasons. Kelley wasn’t there anymore. His nameplate was removed. His presence was erased and replaced by Jimmy Cordero because Kelley had spiked his glove and glared into the Nationals’ dugout out of frustration after allowing a home run in Tuesday’s rout. General Manager Mike Rizzo designated Kelley for assignment a couple hours later after trading Brandon Kintzler, whom the Nationals believed was a malcontent, earlier in the day. Rizzo acted swiftly and defiantly. Unlike Tuesday night’s shellacking, Wednesday’s 5-3 win over the Mets did not end on a sour note. It was as routine as a journeyman outdueling a bona fide ace can get. The Nationals pounced on Noah Syndergaard early, watched Tommy Milone sparkle over seven innings, and added insurance in their last at-bats to afford their new-look bullpen some breathing room. [Mike Rizzo delivers a message for Nationals: ‘If you’re not in, you’re in the way’] The Nationals (54-53) didn’t unload another batch of fireworks following Tuesday’s historic discharge, but they jumped out front on Syndergaard with Bryce Harper’s RBI single in the first. The hit, a groundball up the middle, hiked Harper’s batting average to .225. It was the highest it’s been since the middle of June. He finished 2 for 4, and with a .226 batting average. In the third inning, Anthony Rendon extended the lead to 3-0 with a two-run home run, his 16th this season. Meantime, Milone, a Mets castoff and journeyman, was silencing an anemic New York lineup. The left-hander compiled six strikeouts through three innings. He kept the Mets scoreless until the fifth, when Jose Reyes, who made his pitching debut the previous night, socked a solo home run. The homer was Reyes’s first since April 29 and second this season, matching the home run total he allowed on the mound Tuesday. After pitching to an 8.56 ERA in 11 appearances with the Mets last season, Milone limited his former team to the one run across seven innings. He compiled nine strikeouts, his most since 2013 and one short of his career high. Milone’s outing extended the Nationals rotation’s recent success: Over the past week, Washington’s starters have posted the best ERA in the National League. It’s a tiny sample size, but encouraging. The Nationals are a dangerous team when their starting rotation is good. They’re bad when it’s not. This season is evidence. Milone’s standout performance was necessary because Syndergaard settled in. Making his first start since going on the disabled list because of hand, foot, and mouth disease, Syndergaard retired 12 straight batters after Rendon’s home run. He then surrendered a leadoff single to Daniel Murphy in the seventh inning, but escaped unscathed. Syndergaard’s effort kept it a two-run game, a lead that Reyes halved with a solo home run off Ryan Madson for his 11th career multi-homer game. Suddenly, the Nationals were in a high-pressure spot for the first time without Sean Doolittle and Kintzler. Madson did not yield another run, though, and Washington tacked on a couple more runs to pad the cushion for Kelvin Herrera, the closer until Doolittle returns, in the ninth inning. The Nationals needed the extra leeway because Herrera allowed a flyball to the warning that a leaping Juan Soto knocked over the wall for a solo home run. Herrera then surrendered a double to Michael Conforto and walked Jose Bautista before getting Brandon Nimmo to ground into a game-ending double play.

(Patrick Semansky/AP)   by Sam Fortier August 1 at 12:07 PM Email the author   OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Robert Griffin III stepped to the microphone and grinned at the reporters as if he’d missed this. It was late morning at Under Armour Performance Center and the Baltimore Ravens, his third team in four years, had just finished practice. As Griffin started to respond to a reporter who greeted him, he realized how close the mic was to his mouth. “This is awkward,” he said, flashing his familiar, gaptoothed smile. The grin had been seen rarely since Griffin, for whom the Washington Redskins traded a bounty of draft picks to select second overall in 2012, the year after he won the Heisman Trophy at Baylor, carried Washington to its first playoff appearance in five seasons as a rookie. That year, Griffin’s jersey sold more than any other in the league, and a brand was born: “RG3.” Just a few years later, Griffin had all but vanished from the realm of NFL relevancy. Injuries and a building tension between Griffin and Washington set up an ugly end, and after an injury-shortened season in Cleveland, he was out of the league. At the mic, Griffin tried to distance himself from what happened down the Beltway while facing questions about how he would dig himself out of the rubble of once-great expectations. Ravens Coach John Harbaugh told reporters Griffin’s absence from the game for a year didn’t worry him, that it “wasn’t a very hard” call to sign him and General Manager Ozzie Newsome had decided “pretty quickly.” Griffin, 28, answered with a similar earnestness. He compared being away from football to “someone taking your girl, it gives you an appreciation,” joked about staying in shape by throwing footballs at palm trees, and asserted he was faster than rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson, another speedy Heisman winner who was drafted No. 32 overall in April as the heir apparent to starting quarterback Joe Flacco. In discussing that year away, Griffin never mentioned how much he prepared for life after football — or how the 2020 Olympic Games had come to mind. Griffin understands it will take more than his natural talent for him to make the team. The Ravens have not carried three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster since 2009. He will have his first chance to show everyone what can still do on Thursday, as Baltimore faces Chicago in the Hall of Fame Game at 8 p.m. “Everyone laughs about the sayings I had when I first came into the league, but ‘No pressure, no diamonds’ is one that stuck with me,” Griffin told The Washington Post. “That’s what we said in college. I’ve been under a lot of pressure in my life. I’ve been under a lot of pressure in my NFL career. I’m ready to shine. I think God’s prepared me for it.”    Griffin is likely third on the team’s QB depth chart behind starter Joe Flacco (right) and rookie first-round pick Lamar Jackson (not pictured). (Patrick Semansky/AP)  To listen to Griffin tell it, leaving football “never crossed my mind.” Those around him got a different impression. In the summer of 2017, he was living in Orlando with his second wife, Estonian heptathlete Grete Sadeiko. He received contract offers from Arizona and Baltimore, but neither situation seemed right because of personnel or timing, so he turned them down. Still, though, he trained. “Anyone going through something hard has doubts,” Griffin said, quickly clarifying that he never doubted himself throughout this process. He meant those around him. “My wife would say, ‘Why are you doing this? Why are you running these hills? Why are you throwing these footballs, studying this film? You’re not getting that call. Why keep doing that?’” Last winter, Griffin cold-called a training facility he’d heard of near home and, within a week, he walked into the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. The facility appealed to Griffin because it had football and a track-and-field program, helmed by famous coach Brooks Johnson, who also trained Sadeiko. At Baylor, Griffin ran the 400-meter hurdles all the way to the 2008 Olympic Trials semifinals but left track — even though “at heart, I’m a track guy” — to focus on football. He started to consider a comeback. Griffin split time between the football and track workouts, where he trained alongside Olympians, including Justin Gatlin, the reigning world-champion sprinter who last year outran Usain Bolt for the gold in the 100-meter dash. Griffin, who once weighed more than 225 pounds, had slimmed down to 193. He spoke with Johnson about preparing for the decathlon or the 110-meter hurdles. “He didn’t look at himself as RG3,” Gatlin said. “He looked at himself as Robert. He was hungry, and he had another a shot to get back out there.”     Robert Griffin III took the NFL by storm during his rookie season with the Redskins in 2012. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)     American sprinter Justin Gatlin said that within a year, Griffin would have been seriously contending for a spot in the Olympics. (Jae C. Hong/AP)    For about 10 weeks, Griffin arrived at the facility four days per week at 8:30 a.m. and, over the next five hours, stretched, lifted weights, honed footwork and threw to receivers. Whenever workouts called for speed, he sidled over to Johnson. When asked if track was a plan B, Griffin said he didn’t think so, citing one of his favorite quotes from actor Will Smith: “There’s no reason to have a plan B because it distracts from plan A.” But the track group watched Griffin chip away at his rusty technique. At first, his body launched wide and splayed over the hurdles, but it quickly became tighter. Griffin is 6-foot-2, but Gatlin said football’s emphasis on low centers of gravity conditioned Griffin to run as if he were 5-foot-2. His short strides generated less power. Slowly, Griffin ran straighter, lengthening his legs. The knee injury that hampered his football career seemed to have no effect. Within a year, Gatlin and Johnson said, Griffin would have seriously contended for a spot at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. “He is an Olympic-level talent,” Johnson said. “It didn’t take a lot to get him technically sound.” Then Baltimore called. It was late March, at the beginning of free agency, and Griffin considered it “a message from God” and that “things don’t just happen by accident.” He inked a one-year, $1.1 million deal. In the facility, during stretches and cool-downs, Griffin started bringing index cards made from the Ravens playbook. While they worked out together, Sadeiko quizzed him on the team’s formations and he listed off the personnel. Some people around Griffin attribute his shelving of track, again, to the money at stake in the NFL. For others, it’s deeper. Griffin’s life has seemingly been governed by the same purpose since his uncle signed him up for youth football two decades ago. He was recently told by two global track powers that he’s still got it, and he still returned to the sport where he’s torn his right anterior cruciate ligament twice, dislocated his left ankle once, snapped a bone in his left shoulder and sustained at least two documented concussions. He spent one season as a third-string quarterback, appearing at safety on the practice squad, and another completely away from the game and still, each time, he found it harder to stay away than come back. He does not feel a biological imperative to play football. He feels a religious one. “I know what God’s called me to do,” Griffin said. “He’s called me to play football at a high level, inspire men, lead men. That’s why I didn’t have any doubt in what I was doing.” During a training session in the practice complex earlier this year, football coach Bert Whigham walked by Griffin, who was talking to a player preparing for the NFL Draft. “One day football will be done with you,” Whigham heard Griffin tell the prospect, “but you’ll never be done with football.”    “I know what God’s called me to do,” Griffin said. “He’s called me to play football at a high level, inspire men, lead men. That’s why I didn’t have any doubt in what I was doing.” (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)  On the third day of training camp, Griffin ran off the field, swigged from a water bottle and sank down on his right knee next to his wife on Practice Field 1. After the final whistle blew, Griffin had spent about 20 minutes sprinting and throwing corner routes to the end zone, as he always does. Griffin spoke for about 15 minutes with his wife, whose back rested against the goal post. The fields were otherwise empty. A couple of Ravens staffers and the few fans who weren’t scrunched up behind a yellow rope separating the practice field, mostly young boys, stared at Griffin and his wife, then whispered to one another. A group of fans walked by Griffin, and Griffin obliged the oldest man’s request for a picture and autograph. A few moments later, Flacco walked out of a team-facility door. “Oh my God, oh my God!” one of the boys yelled at his seven friends. “Guys, look who it is!” The boys, and everyone else, rushed to Flacco’s side. They clamored for him to stand next to them for the camera and sign their helmets, balls and jerseys. Hearing the commotion, Griffin turned and saw the mob around Flacco. He stared at the starting quarterback, playing the part that once seemed destined to be his, and his face remained blank.    When the Ravens called, Griffin considered it “a message from God.” (Patrick Semansky/AP)  ',\n",

But this week, the missionaries for QAnon used their physical bodies to spread the word, with T-shirts and a paper sign, “We are Q,” aimed at the cameras covering President Trump’s campaign rally. People noticed, including journalists. The signs became mainstream news, and the news of QAnon spread. On Reddit’s “Great Awakening” discussion board, devoted to QAnon and its supporters, a user wrote, “QAnon is finally trending on Twitter!” QAnon is as convoluted as any other conspiracy theory out there but with one distinguishing feature: QAnon is the result of a twisted sort of optimism. It gives the people who believe in the conspiracy Internet hope that a reckoning is about to hit. [Algorithms are one reason a conspiracy theory goes viral. Another reason might be you.] The layers of the conspiracy go like this: Take your standard Democratic pedophilia ring and world-domination fantasy, but that’s only the base, like the crust of a pizza. Onto this, you layer a fantasy in which President Trump, while posing as a flailing president in public, is secretly orchestrating a crackdown on the entire cabal. Trump is working behind the scenes with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whose real federal investigation is aimed at the Clintons. Trump has loyalists spread through the U.S. intelligence agencies, which are otherwise dens of the cabal. The crackdown is imminent. It’s always imminent, and it will be glorious. Better yet, we don’t need to simply wait in ignorance, because a high level operative in Trump’s alliance has for the last nine months been communicating with the public through cryptic posts on an anonymous Internet forum. This is how it spread from there. Whether he knows it or not, Trump birthed the QAnon conspiracy theory with a single sentence, uttered to reporters while he posed with senior military leaders for a photo op in October last year. “You guys know what this represents?” Trump said, gesturing to the uniforms. “Maybe it’s the calm before the storm.” When reporters asked what storm, Trump refused to explain. This led to a brief burst of public speculation that he was hinting at a military strike. But no strike came, and soon most of the world forgot about the strange comment. But the thinking progressed very differently on hard-right Internet forums such as 4chan’s /pol/, where thousands of anonymous commenters literally deify Trump — as a messianic revolutionary who conceals his strategic genius under layers of crass egotism and ineptitude. On those forums, Trump’s comment was filled with meaning, and his “storm” must be imminent. For weeks, amateur theorists batted around ideas of what Trump’s storm might be. If not a military strike, perhaps it was a crackdown on the so-called deep state — Obama loyalists the president claims infest his administration. If not that, then something else. 4chan is entirely anonymous, so no one theory or theorist stood out from any other. Until Q came along. Their posts promised 4chan that exactly what it was hoping for was about to come true. Q’s first string of posts on Oct. 28 did not read like typical forum speculation. They were written with authority and phrased as cryptic prophecy. Many referenced mockingbirds. Operation “Mockingbird,” Q hinted in another post (more than 70 appeared on various forums within the first week), referred the imminent arrest of Hillary Clinton. This would, Q promised, be followed by the detention of other liberals, globalists and “an evil corrupt network of players” that had controlled the world for decades — until Trump came along and outmaneuvered them. When their early predictions did not come true, Q simply made more predictions, all the while dropping hints that suggested Q was a high-level operative embedded in Trump’s counter-conspiracy. (The “Q” in their pseudonym stands for Q-level security clearance — or basically super-duper top secret.) Q once posted\\xa0in entirety: _Conf_goTWIT_P_act-small#_ RED1_RED2_ Q Nonsense? Probably, but later that same afternoon in November, Trump tweeted, “Happy #SmallBusinessSaturday” Small and small. To devotees, it’s proof that Trump really is working with Q. As is the nature of a good conspiracy theory, believers began to do Q’s work for Q. After so many missed predictions, the dispatches tended to become even more cryptic. But cryptic worked. Quickly and quietly, at first, QAnonism spread from 4chan and 8chan to small conspiracy news sites, personal blogs, Twitter and YouTube. Some videos devoted to QAnon theories have hundreds of thousands of views on the platform. Q’s messages were so vague that fans could easily graft their preferred fantasy villains onto its cabal of Democrat-led globalists\\xa0 — the Illuminati or the Rothschilds, for example. And as it spread, its circles of supporters discussed how to spread the word. To express this feeling, some started to quote a specific line from the Bible:    Image/Twitter  QAnon spread further through an “unholy combination” of media manipulation and true belief, said Whitney Phillips, an incoming assistant professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University. Although the posts about QAnon have the feeling of a religion, or a cult, there’s no way to truly know whether QAnon’s evangelists are spreading the conspiracy theory because they believe it is true — or because, as is often the case with 4chan, they just want to spread chaos. Maybe it’s a combination of both. “When you are talking about traditional\\xa0proselytizers, you can take seriously that the people doing it are actually, [for example], Mormons, who trust that they believe they are doing the right thing,” said Phillips, whose work often focuses on the amplification of misinformation and media manipulation. “In this particular case, you can have that evangelical drive without trusting that they are actually believing what they are selling.” The only thing to know for sure about the spread of QAnon is that its evangelists want to make themselves, and the conspiracy theory, more visible. Over the next several months, that drive worked, helped along by the wild and confusing daily narrative coming from the White House. “It\\xa0provides coherence to a real-world narrative that is so lacking in coherence,” Phillips said. “The conspiracy is a way to understand it more clearly, even if you are engaging with it as a joke.” In early January, the wildly popular Fox News host Sean Hannity gave #QAnon a major signal boost, helping the theory rocket into mainstream consciousness.   Watch @wikileaks closely! Tick tock. https://t.co/LOEtsBCXE7— Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) January 9, 2018    Roseanne Barr became an apparent devotee, and in March her public theorizing morphed into\\xa0a string of bizarre, racist tweets that led to the cancellation of her hit TV show. As Isaac Stanley-Becker wrote elsewhere in The Washington Post, an armed militant group became convinced that a homeless camp was a secret base for child sex-trafficking rings, which feature heavily in QAnon fantasies. This week, Q posted a picture of an office belonging to a lawyer critical of Trump, after which a man showed up prowling around outside the building — bizarre enough to concern police. About a month ago, Q evangelists began to target members the White House press corps — reporters who regularly get to question the president’s press secretary — in their quest to spread the word. “I started getting these emails and DMs and replies to everything I’d tweet: ‘Ask about Q,’ ” said Saagar Enjeti, who reports for the Daily Caller. He said the requests were not coming from the Caller’s regular audience, which leans conservative — but from members of an online fringe he had not known existed. A brief dip into those anonymous forums was enough to persuade Enjeti that he would not be asking Trump if he was secretly allied with Q.   I will not be asking the White House about Q-Anon because it is a batshit crazy conspiracy theory. Please stop tweeting at me, DM'ing me, or emailing me about it— Saagar Enjeti (@esaagar) July 3, 2018    Only after he tweeted his refusal did he realize how deep Q fervor ran. “I’m no stranger to nasty DMs, but this was insane,” Enjeti said. “I think I probably got over 60 to 70 DMs on Twitter; people went to my Facebook page; people found my Instagram and started going through old photos: “Ask about Q. You’ll be famous. What is there to lose? Ask about Q, you coward.” “An acquaintance of mine, her mother called her and told her to tell me I’d lost my rocker,” Enjeti said. “I need to ask about Q to prove my bona fides.” He’s seen viral conspiracy theories come and go — sometimes on the left, sometimes on the right. He usually rolls his eyes at them. “I think this one is truly, legitimately dangerous,” Enjeti said. “The rhetoric, and the dedicated base of believers, and the patterns of propensity for violence. I think it’s only a matter of time before someone abuses the open access of the White House, in terms of getting a press pass and causing a scene. “Nothing is outside the realm of possibility,” he said. It took a paper sign reading “I am Q” to bring the conspiracy theory to its latest threshold of visibility. Enjeti decided not to ask the White House about QAnon. But now, as curiosity about it is spreading, the conspiracy is becoming a series of explanatory articles. Phillips said that when journalists become involved in reporting on things like QAnon, conspiracy evangelists benefit from the core belief that drives journalism itself — to provide the public with truthful information. “The problem is that the information is exactly what the evangelists want. It risks bringing more people into the story who can be converted,” Phillips said. “These reports, they are serving an important function even as they are doing the worst possible thing they could do.” More reading: ‘We are Q’: A deranged conspiracy cult leaps from the Internet to the crowd at Trump’s ‘MAGA’ tour The conspiracy theory behind a curious Roseanne Barr tweet, explained A short history of Alex Jones claiming that the left is about to start a second Civil War \", 'QAnon: How the conspiracy theory spawned by a Trump quip got so big and scary - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/08/01/police-issue-warrant-in-killing-of-george-h-w-bushs-doctor-say-suspect-held-20-year-grudge/?utm_term=.388a33dd7ab3': ('window.havePowaBoot=true;  by Erin B.

Wootson Jr. August 1 at 3:47 PM Email the author        The 13-year-old was wearing dark clothes covered in dirt and stiffened by ice on a freezing night in January. He was joyriding in a golf cart on a Georgia state highway — and the stories he told the officers who stopped him weren’t adding up. The golf cart was his mom’s, he said. She let him borrow it after he promised to be careful. Then, he said, his mom was on a date, and he had grabbed a golf cart from the apartment complex where she worked. Then he claimed he got the vehicle from a “science school,” whose name had slipped his memory. That wasn’t the only detail that was foggy. He claimed he didn’t remember his mom’s phone number or name or address and was even sketchy on the year she was born. It was either in “2000-and-something,”\\xa0or in 1896, he told increasingly frustrated Roswell, Ga., police officers. “Every 10 minutes, you tell me a different story, and I don’t know what’s going on right now,” Officer C. Dickerson told the boy on police body-camera footage after the boy told her he didn’t want to go to jail. The body-camera footage,\\xa0obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, was released this week. “Are you who you say you are? You have no identification on you. Are you really 13 years old?” Their worry morphed into frustration at the boy’s inconsistent answers. Dickerson searched him for weapons, slapped handcuffs on his wrists and placed him into the back of her patrol cruiser. Several officers then tried to figure out their graveyard-shift conundrum. They didn’t think this early-morning joyride merited a trip to a juvenile detention center, but they couldn’t exactly let the teen hop in the golf cart and drive away. Finding the teen’s parents was crucial, but they had no leverage to make him fess up. “He’s just lying,” one officer said of the boy. “He’s not going to tell you the truth. He hasn’t told you the truth since he met you.” Then Sgt. Daniel Elzey voiced an idea that would land the Roswell, Ga., police department in the middle of its third national-headline-grabbing police misconduct scandal of 2018. “Officer Dickerson,” he said, “can\\xa0 you hop in my passenger seat for a few minutes?” [‘I’m going to hit him’: Dash-cam video shows officers tried to run over man before shooting him 14 times] Then he rolled down all four windows in Dickerson’s car and left the handcuffed 13-year-old in the cold to see whether a temperature change would jog his memory. Sitting in his own car, with the heat blasting and at least one police body camera running, Elzey explained his attempt to gain leverage. “It’s fine,” he said. “Give him a few minutes to think about it. Let him get a little chilly. Maybe that’ll help.” A few minutes later, the officer got out of the car to see whether the child’s resolve had thawed. “All right, partner, what’s your name?” he asked. “Getting cold yet?” The teen responded that he wasn’t bothered by the tactic, and the officer shot a taunt right back. “You can take it? Cool. So can I,” he said. “Because I’ve got heat in this car.” The interaction was one of several that have left the department with a black eye.

The dog, Robbie, received 20 commands to stop from his handler but didn’t. The department never took Robbie out of service. And in April, Roswell officers used a coin flip app to determine whether they should arrest a woman they stopped for speeding at nearly 90 mph, as The Washington Post’s Alex Horton reported. Although it was tails — a “release” based on the terms of the coin toss — officers arrested Sarah Webb anyway. The coin flip was captured on police body cameras, and although the charges were ultimately dismissed, the officers’ actions incensed people across the nation, perhaps most of all Webb. When she learned about the coin flip that occurred as she sat in the back of a patrol cruiser, sobbing, she told the Associated Press the officers’ actions were “disgusting.” Also unhappy was Roswell City Administrator Gary Palmer, who called for an independent study to “scrutinize every aspect of our police operations” based on several recent incidents. “It is clear to me, the Mayor and Council and the Chief of Police that what you are seeing are symptoms of bigger issues; issues that we need to clearly identify and deliberately address as expeditiously as possible,” Palmer said in a statement. “I am stunned by the lack of professionalism and compassion displayed by some of our officers,” he added.

Some called on Police Chief Rusty Grant to resign, saying the department he leads has become toxic. Roswell police didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Elzey and Dickerson couldn’t immediately be reached, although the Journal-Constitution said Elzey has been put on administrative leave during an internal investigation. The boy in the back of Dickerson’s car was never publicly identified. The video ends as he is escorted, handcuffed, into an apartment by police. The report they filed refers to him as a child who has been suspended several times, according to the Journal-Constitution. It makes no note of the controversial tactic to get him to talk.

Alphonse Capone summoned a tailor from Chicago’s Marshall Field & Co. in 1927. The tailor arrived at the Metropole Hotel, where Capone commanded most of the fourth floor. Capone and his men needed suits, but specially made with pockets that could hold revolvers. The tailor got to work. Altogether, 27 suits from the company made their way to Capone and his men, according to Jonathan Eig’s book “Get Capone: The Secret Plot That Captured America’s Most Wanted Gangster.” Those suits were among many purchases that helped seal the fate of Capone, a notorious gangster convicted not of murder or bootlegging, but tax evasion. That case, Eig told The Washington Post on Wednesday, was built by highlighting Capone’s lavish spending to prove that he actually had income from illegal means. Capone’s grand criminal conspiracy, in other words, was unraveled by the purchase of every silk sock and expertly hemmed coat that materialized without any sort of documented income. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort,\\xa0weathering accusations of tax and bank fraud, conspiracy against the United States, obstruction of justice and other charges, probably did not want to be compared to Capone. [Paul Manafort trial: Executive at ‘most expensive store’ testifies that Manafort paid for suits via wire transfers] But on Wednesday, President Trump went there, and evoked Capone to suggest that Manafort has received historically harsh treatment from prosecutors. “Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and “Public Enemy Number One,” or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement – although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?” Trump said on Twitter. There are some parallels, though not some that Trump may have intended. Manfort’s trial began this week in Alexandria, Va., and started with the prosecution detailing the luxurious lifestyle Manafort enjoyed after consulting with the Ukrainian government. Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye said he used the money from that work to buy, among other things, a $15,000 jacket made from ostrich skin, a $21,000 watch and a $2 million dollar home. But he did not pay taxes on those funds, Asonye claimed.    Al Capone, left, called before a grand jury, talks to an unidentified man in Chicago on March 21, 1929. Capone was charged with tax evasion in 1931 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. (AP)  And then there were the suits. Manafort bought a lot of them, luxury menswear seller Maximillian Katzman testified Wednesday. He paid $929,000 for suits over a five-year period, Katzman said, and the transactions were unusual. Most customers paid by check. Manafort was the only customer to pay with foreign bank transactions. The prosecution strategy to focus on extravagant spending appears similar to the Capone tax case,\\xa0 Eig said. Jurors in Capone’s case were possibly drinkers, and a charge of bootlegging during Prohibition may not have incensed them. But defiantly cheating the tax man as working stiffs toiled for their salaries in 1931, while the Great Depression gripped the country? “That’s a really good way to turn the jury’s anger toward a defendant,” Eig told The Post. “It makes the issue emotional. Everyone can look at it and say, ‘Something is not right about that.’\\xa0” Documents from the investigation later released by the IRS highlighted those high-priced items. Capone’s suits, for instance,\\xa0cost $135 apiece. That would be nearly $2,000 today, and Capone bought 27 in one year. [Here are six things you need to know about Paul Manafort’s trial] They also documented silk ties, luxury underwear, homes for family members, cars, hotels and virtually any trapping of a gangster, Eig said. The big-ticket items bought by Manafort have also been noted. Cars. Watches. More than $900,000 in rugs. When your money comes in faster than you can spend it, Eig said, “it’s like being on a nuclear-powered expense account.” The government knew Capone was likely to evade most charges related to murder, racketeering and other crimes, so taxes became a low-hanging fruit, Eig said. In some ways, focusing on Manafort’s spending may be a way to bring clarity to potential misdeeds. It’s easier for a jury to understand than, say, acting as a foreign agent. But Capone is a curious comparison for the president to use, Eig said. “Capone was obviously guilty as hell. I don’t know if you want to compare your man to him,” Eig said of Trump.

Intestinal parasites that can cause severe and painful symptoms may have tainted beef, pork and poultry in certain salads and wrap products made between July 15 and 18 with sell-by dates of July 18 through 23, the agency said Monday. Food inspection officials are concerned that some of the products sold at Trader Joe's, Kroger and Walgreens may still be in home refrigerators and have urged consumers to throw them out or return them to stores.

It is the same parasite responsible for a nationwide outbreak linked to McDonald's salads last month, causing at least 286 confirmed illnesses in 11 states, the CDC said. The outbreak triggered recalls at thousands of stores. The romaine lettuce used in some of the products in this new warning came from Fresh Express, which was linked to the McDonald's outbreak.

According to the pollsters, Republican Troy Balderson now holds a statistically insignificant lead of 44 percent to 43 percent over Democrat Danny O’Connor. That represents a surge for O’Connor since Monmouth’s last poll, six weeks ago, when Balderson led by 10 points. “This race has definitely tightened in the past month,” said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a statement accompanying the numbers. “This is similar to the trend we saw in our polling of the Pennsylvania special election earlier this year.” O’Connor’s own polling, which the campaign has released to the media each week, has found a similar trend, with the Democrat gaining ground on Balderson but the Republican holding onto a lead. That polling also showed a Green Party candidate pulling equally from both candidates; an important factor, after a Libertarian Party candidate’s presence on the ballot helped Democrat Conor Lamb win the March 13 special election in Pennsylvania that became a lab test for Democratic campaigns this year. Republicans, who have easily held the district and its predecessors since 1983, have rung louder and louder alarms about the chance of a Democratic upset. Early and absentee voting, which began last month, has found Democrats requesting ballots at a higher rate than they did ahead of the 2016 election. According to the Columbus Dispatch,\\xa054 percent of early absentee applications in Delaware County, where Trump will campaign on Saturday, have come from Democrats. In the 2016 election, Democratic ballot requests accounted for just 30 percent of the early vote, and Trump went on to win the suburban Columbus county by 16 points. Monmouth’s polling has found far more enthusiasm for voting from Democrats; one of the pollster’s models suggested that O’Connor would lead by one point if the party pulled off a “turnout surge.” Trump is just one part of the GOP’s strategy to prevent that. Vice President Pence has made two stops in the district, in conservative strongholds. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who waited until last week to endorse Balderson, now appears in an ad sponsored by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).      Kasich, who won the district in a landslide in his 2014 reelection, may appeal more to swing voters than the president. Monmouth found the president’s approval rating in the district slipping to 46 percent; he had won 53 percent of the vote there in 2016. While voters approved of the GOP’s 2017 tax cut bill by a 12-point margin, they opposed the president’s current trade and tariff polices by the same margin — with just 34 percent of voters expecting them to help the rural and suburban district.

But the company doesn’t appear to have enough money to pay for all of its subscribers’ movie tickets, to the point that pundits are predicting\\xa0the company could shutter its doors within a week. [MoviePass is taking a step critical to its survival — that could also doom it] MoviePass, meanwhile, announced Monday that it is raising the price of its standard subscription from $9.95 to $14.95 and limiting availability to movies that open on more than 1,000 screens. (The company did not explain exactly\\xa0what this limitation was, and it declined The Post’s request for comment.) So what’s the big deal with MoviePass, anyway? And how did we get here? The service began innocuously enough, chugging along for six years before the public took notice. It was a subscription movie service, meaning that for a monthly fee, users could see a set amount of movies in major theaters. The price and number of movies changed throughout those years. Then, in June 2016, Lowe — touting his role as a Netflix co-founder — took over as CEO and made two monumental changes:  Lowered the price to $9.95 per month, or $6.95 per month if you purchased a year-long subscription. (It was about $50 at its peak.) Raised the number of movies users could see to one a day.  MoviePass\\xa0exploded. Despite the service being riddled with technical difficulties — one personal example: It took more than two months for my account to be activated, even though I had paid in full — users were generally ecstatic.

AMC released a press release bluntly titled: “‘AMC Theatres Statement about MoviePass Announcement: ‘Not Welcome Here.’\\u2009” “From what we can tell, by definition and absent some other form of other compensation, MoviePass will be losing money on every subscriber seeing two movies or more in a month,” the release stated, adding, “AMC noted that it is not yet known how to turn lead into gold.” [The MoviePass deal: For less than $120 a year, you can see 365 movies. Here’s the catch.] AMC wasn’t the only one\\xa0wondering how the service would make money.\\xa0Many thought MoviePass was following the gym model — get users to pay a monthly fee in hopes that they wouldn’t use it. But the company said it was in the data business, collecting information on its users to potentially sell to studios. That argument seemed flawed when it dropped access to some of the most-trafficked AMC theaters. But that didn’t really seem to matter. The service continued enticing both casual moviegoers and modern-day\\xa0Binx Bollings, proving to be such a good deal that even obvious privacy concerns didn’t turn anyone away. Those concerns only grew as Lowe spewed some pretty Orwellian rhetoric — such as when he announced the company can track users’ phones using GPS. “We watch how you drive from home to the movies,” he once said. “We watch where you go afterward.” Users stuck around anyway. More, in fact, flocked to it. But despite the service’s growing base — and, in addition,\\xa0because of the service’s growing base — cracks in the company’s model were becoming too obvious to ignore. By April, panic was in the air.

The Verge said the service “is no longer too good to be true.” “If you’re using the service — or thinking about signing up — you should probably get the most out of its too-good-to-be-true offer before it’s too late,” warned Lifehacker. Meanwhile, words such as “scam” began to pop up on social media. “It’s been 3 days and you guys still have not addressed the reason why you changed the terms & conditions. I paid $100+ in advance for a year of unlimited and now I can’t see the same movie. #scam #moviepass #baitandswitch,” one Twitter user wrote. “Hey @MoviePass I paid for a year for a product that allowed me to see a movie once a day. I paid for this before you changed your terms. I need you to hold up your bargain until my subscription ends. Then I will decide if I want to renew with new terms. #scam #moviepass,” wrote another. Things have only gotten worse. The service was unavailable to most users last Thursday, and the company was forced to take out a $5 million loan — essentially to keep the lights on. Helios and Matheson’s stock dropped by 40 percent on Monday. Perhaps most damaging of all, many of its 3 million users don’t even seem fed up any more.

The automaker said that it had made $4 billion in car, battery and leasing revenue during the second quarter of the year, a sharp increase over the same quarter last year because it had finally introduced its newest Model 3 sedan. The stock climbed about 4 percent in after-hours trading. Tesla’s second-quarter losses of $743 million were lower than analysts’ estimates, of about $900 million. But its cash burn extended a money-losing streak for chief Elon Musk during one of the company’s most challenging years in history. The results marked a critical moment for a $50 billion company long believed to be on the brink. It was the last financial update before the second half of the year, when Musk had vowed the company would be profitable. [Inside the Tesla Factory: Burning cash, and trying not to burn out] “It took 15 years to execute on our initial goal to produce an affordable, long-range electric vehicle that can also be highly profitable,” Musk wrote in a shareholder letter Wednesday. “In the second half of 2018, we expect, for the first time in our history, to become both sustainably profitable and cash flow positive.” Musk tweeted in April that the company’s profitability would mean it would have “no need to raise money,” but the company currently has billions of dollars in debt, including more than $1 billion that will need to be paid or refinanced within the next year. The earnings announcement and a following call with investment analysts have been widely anticipated by both Tesla boosters and critics for signs of Tesla’s performance — and for how the outspoken Musk would react. In May, during the company’s first-quarter earnings call, Musk berated analysts for asking what he said were “boring, bonehead” questions. But Musk proved far more subdued during Wednesday’s call, apologizing to analysts he had clashed with during the last call for being “impolite.” “No excuse for bad manners,” Musk said, adding that at the time he was working overly long hours on “no sleep.” Tesla is America’s youngest major automaker and has at times been valued more than General Motors and the other Detroit auto giants it has pledged to distrupt. But it is also the most heavily shorted company on Wall Street, with an army of investors betting billions that the cash-burning company’s turbulence would ensure its imminent collapse. The company’s cash reserves have dropped to $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the end of last year. In June, Musk said the company would reduce costs by laying off 9 percent of its workforce. Tesla’s stock has fallen more than 18 percent since its June peak. Musk reiterated that the company would “not be raising any equity at any point.” “Are we running low on money? The answer is no,” Musk said. Tesla clinched a long-delayed milestone in late June when it announced it had built more than 5,000 of its Model 3 sedans in a week — a pace Musk has said would quickly shepherd the company into profitability. In celebrating that goal, Musk upped the ante, saying the company would produce 6,000 a week by the end of August. [At Tesla, Elon Musk casts himself as a superhero. But he sweats the details on the factory floor.] Tesla said Wednesday that its lone car-making factory in Fremont, Calif., had made 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week multiple times during July and should be able to continue at that rate through the third quarter. “We aim to increase production to 10,000 Model 3s per week as fast as we can,” Musk wrote in the Wednesday letter, though he offered no estimated timeline. \"It’s fair to say that no production ramp of any other product has been as closely watched and debated as that of Model 3.” The company has struggled to deliver the Model 3, which critics have celebrated as a “modern marvel,” at a price cheap enough to win over new buyers who have been priced out of Tesla’s luxury line. Though promised as a $35,000 mass-market car, the only models available now sell for about $50,000 or more. Tesla also faces broader challenges that could make its cars more difficult to sell. The company’s sale of its 200,000th vehicle last month triggered the phase-out period for a $7,500-per-car federal tax credit granted by the Obama administration to encourage the sale of electric cars. That credit will be halved for Tesla buyers next year and dwindle down to zero in the following months. Musk himself has garnered headlines in recent months for all the wrong reasons, including after calling a hero of the Thai cave rescue a “pedo.” Musk later apologized. The rocky results Wednesday will probably encourage Tesla skeptics who have criticized the company as underdelivering on its promise of reshaping the auto industry. In a letter Tuesday to clients, billionaire hedge-fund manager David Einhorn criticized Tesla’s manufacturing sprint and questioned “whether customers will be happy with the quality of a car rushed through production to prove a point to short sellers.” Einhorn, a short seller who had bet against Tesla’s stock, also said he would not renew his own lease on a Model S, blaming touchscreen and window problems. Musk responded to the news on Twitter early Wednesday by saying he would send Einhorn “a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time.” ', 'Tesla posts another loss as the beleaguered automaker seeks to increase production - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/reddit-was-hacked-heres-how-to-learn-if-you-were-affected/2018/08/01/2b4f185b-c9ac-439b-af04-923cc51ba5da_story.html': ('(Jason Alden/Bloomberg)   by Hamza Shaban August 1 at 3:04 PM Email the author   Reddit announced on Wednesday that a hacker broke into its computer systems in June, gaining access to the email addresses of some of its users and a database of user names from 2007. The company did not say how many users may have been affected. But those affected will soon receive a message from Reddit alerting them of the intrusion, the company said. The 2007 database contained user names, email addresses, Reddit user posts and private messages. Reddit said it is resetting passwords on these early accounts in which the log-in credentials may still be working. Users who signed up after 2007 were not affected by this part of the data breach.

The digests are short selections of popular posts recommended to users based on the subreddits they subscribe to. But the logs also connected user names with their associated email address. Reddit said that if a user doesn’t have an email address tied to their account or had selected not to receive email digests, then they are not affected by this aspect of the breach. Otherwise, the company recommends that users search their inboxes for emails sent by noreply@redditmail.com between June 3 and June 17 to learn if they were affected. For users whose account credentials were compromised, Reddit will force a password reset. Those users are also encouraged to think about whether they use that password on other sites.

Staff in Matanuska-Susitna, a south-central borough of Alaska, began relying on typewriters after hackers locked them out of their computers and email server, according to the BBC. The perpetrators used what’s known as a ransomware attack, deploying malicious software to take control of digital systems and then demanding payment from the victims to get their data back. While the borough works to bring its systems back online, officials “reenlisted typewriters from closets” and wrote receipts and lists of library members by hand, according to Bleeping Computer, a technology website. The borough said that beginning in mid-July, hackers seized its desktop computers, most of its servers, telephone system and email exchange. On the borough’s home page, visitors are greeted with an arresting banner: “Mat-Su Declares Disaster. Worst of its Kind Cyber Attack.” Borough Manager John Moosey declared the cyberattack a disaster Tuesday, according to a statement by public affairs director Patty Sullivan. Moosey told members of the public at a Borough Assembly meeting that the declaration grants the borough access to its insurance, funds dedicated to emergencies and possibly the assistance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The borough anticipates that the major disruptions caused by the cyberattack may continue for a “prolonged time.” The loss of services and productivity, the borough said, is compounded by the high cost of hiring IT specialists and the “great deal of overtime” that the borough is paying IT department staff. Borough IT Director Eric Wyatt said the perpetrators deployed hacking tools that were the “worst of its type,” citing international cyber experts who have experience with the kind of ransomware that was used. The computer virus that infected the borough has claimed 209 previous victims, he said. “The group that we are facing that has unleashed this particular attack is a very well-organized group, and they’re using the most sophisticated tools and have done a lot of damage across the country to include us.” The data encrypted by the hackers was turned over to the FBI, Wyatt said in a report earlier this week, in the hope that federal agents can recover the decryption keys needed to retrieve the information.

Market intelligence firms IDC, IHS Markit and Canalys all reported that Huawei shipped more phones than Apple in the past quarter. IDC and IHS Markit reported the firm had shipped 54.2 million phones; Canalys estimated it was 54 million. Huawei has almost no market share in the United States because of government accusations that it is tied to the Chinese government. Security worries led to the end of a sales agreement between Huawei and AT&T earlier this year, which would have been a crucial move for Huawei’s efforts to break into the American market. Yet despite being shut out of one of the world’s most lucrative smartphone markets, it has had exceptional success globally, particularly in its home market of China. The company has sold a high volume of lower-priced handsets there, as well as a line of premium devices with innovative features. “The Asia-Pacific region posted the biggest growth in the second quarter, rising 107 percent year over year, while Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) recorded more than 60 percent growth,” IHS Markit analyst Gerrit Schneemann said of Huawei in a research note. The reports came just hours after Apple reported it had sold 41.3 million iPhones over the past quarter. Despite shipping fewer units than analysts had expected, Apple reported that iPhone revenue was up 20 percent from the same period last year. Apple is expected to increase the number of phones it ships significantly in the coming quarter, with the launch of new phones headed into the winter holiday season. Still, analysts said that Huawei’s accomplishment was more than a blip. “The importance of Huawei overtaking Apple this quarter cannot be overstated,” Canalys senior analyst Ben Stanton said in a release. “It is the first time in seven years that Samsung and Apple have not held the top two positions.” Apple should take the change as a warning, he said, as it still needs to sell phones to drive its growing services business.

Fowler August 1 at 12:13 AM Email the author   Brace yourself: Facebook is about to tell you exactly how much time you spend — or is that waste? — on Facebook and Instagram.    Now if you go over your self-imposed time limit on Instagram, this warning will pop up. (Instagram)  Starting Wednesday, new settings called Your Time and Your Activity will begin rolling out in updates to the Facebook and Instagram apps, respectively. Tap into them, and you’ll see a dashboard with how much time you spent using each app over the last week and also get the chance to set up self-imposed daily time limits. A “daily reminder” pop-up with a pause icon will let you know you when you’ve gone over. It’s like the calorie counts on the Cheesecake Factory menu, if they also came with a wag of the finger when you top 3,000 calories. As a confessed Instagram addict, I welcome any help. The new controls are the most visible step yet by Facebook to address growing concern that its apps are too good at sucking us in — and create unhealthy habits or even depression. But I’m dubious how much of a dent this will make. How committed is Facebook really to getting all of us to spend less time on Facebook? Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has lately proclaimed he’s interested in making sure our time is “well spent.” Yet he has incentive to keep us hooked: Facebook makes more money when we spend more time looking at ads and feeding it more data.    New tools in the Instagram app allow members to monitor their daily and weekly use, set reminders to limit their use, and restrict notifications for a few hours.  “It is really important for people that use Instagram and Facebook to feel like the time spent with us it time well spent,” said Instagram product management director Ameet Ranadive, echoing the line from his boss. “There may be some trade off with other metrics for the company. That is a trade-off we are willing to live with.” Facebook’s new screen time controls are similar to functions announced by Apple and Google that will be included in updates to iOS and Android coming later this year. The operating systems will provide data about how much time you spend across all the apps on your phone as well as give you the ability to set daily limits. They also plan to offer controls Facebook probably doesn’t like, such as locking out access to apps and cutting off notifications entirely. (Facebook’s new software also lets you mute notifications from its apps for up to eight hours. But anyone trying to curtail their time using these apps should probably turn off notifications entirely.) [14 years of Mark Zuckerberg saying sorry, not sorry] The assumption in these tech industry efforts is that giving people data about how they’re using their phones will lead to healthier behavior. It can certainly be eye-opening: A pre-release version of the Apple iOS 12 software, which I’ve been using, reports I spent nearly six hours using social networking apps in the past week. But information alone won’t necessarily change behavior. Is my six hours normal, or extreme? Facebook’s controls don’t put your daily tallies in any context, either among your friends or across the country. Instagram reported in August 2017 that users under age 25 spend more than 32 minutes a day on the app, and users older than 25 spend 24 minutes a day. (The company wouldn’t share updated Instagram figures or any Facebook data.) Ranadive said Facebook developed the new software in collaboration with academics and mental health experts as well as by tapping the company’s own research. But he didn’t offer any evidence if or how it changes people’s behavior. The company also didn’t preview its new software with the Center for Humane Technology, a coalition of Silicon Valley execs that has been critical of Facebook’s practices and coined the “time well spent” phrase. [Experts grade Apple’s and Google’s new tools to fight smartphone addiction] What about offering more help to people with the most extreme behavior — the top 0.1 percent who spend hours and hours on Facebook and Instagram daily? “This is just the beginning and we plan to evolve the tools and give people more insights and context,” Ranadive said. Information is also only helpful if you see it. Facebook buried this data in the settings menus few people bother to open. Ranadive says the company will do some “in-app” education to market the features. A few more caveats: The new software also only discloses use of an app on a single device. It won’t tally up how much time you spend on Facebook on both your phone and iPad and won’t measure your use in a Web browser at all. Of course, these software controls don’t do anything to address the social ill that also fuels some of the bad behavior: an expectation that we’re almost constantly online, responding to friends and co-workers. Ultimately, kicking unhealthy habits is going to take willpower and difficult discussions among families, friends and co-workers. Ranadive said: “What I’m most looking forward to is using these tools in conversations with my daughter who turned 13 recently and started using Instagram.” Read more tech reviews and analysis from Geoffrey A.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   by Tony Romm August 1 at 8:53 AM Email the author   President Trump intends to nominate Kelvin Droegemeier, an expert in extreme weather from the University of Oklahoma, as his top science and technology adviser at the White House, according to an administration official. Droegemeier’s selection, if approved by the Senate, could soon end a roughly 19-month vacancy at the top of the Office of Science and Technology Policy — a critical arm of the White House that guides the president on such issues as self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, emerging medical research and climate change. Droegemeier is a meteorologist by trade who has also served in government, including as Oklahoma’s secretary of science and technology, and he aided the federal National Science Board under former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The Washington Post first reported him as a front-runner for the post in March. The White House later confirmed the nomination late Tuesday. His selection drew early praise from the scientific community Tuesday. “I think he’s a very solid choice,” said John Holdren, the former director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy under Obama. “He’s been a serious climate scientist, and he’s been a serious science adviser to people in positions of influence.” Yet Droegemeier still may have to overcome a tough Senate confirmation process, given that Democrats and Republicans have regularly locked horns over many of Trump’s nominees. This time, some Democrats could turn Droegemeier’s selection into a moment to fight the president on his energy and climate policies, more than a year after Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from a major international carbon-reduction treaty. Marcia McNutt, the president of the National Academy of Sciences, said Tuesday in an interview that she was “not sure what his personal views” are on climate science. But she praised Droegemeier’s character and pedigree. “As an atmospheric scientist, he will understand these weather-related problems are connected to the climate system as well, and weather and climate are intricately connected.” “He will have to walk a very careful line given the president’s very strong views on this, but we hope he still can be a measured influence with the administration,” McNutt said. Since Trump has taken office, the White House’s science-and-tech arm, known as the OSTP, has focused much of its work on enabling emerging technologies. Last year, for example, it helped launch a federal program that now allows cities and states to partner with dronemakers to test more autonomous craft, including those that deliver packages, in select locations across the country. In March, the OSTP also helped convene top executives from Amazon, Facebook, Google, Intel and 34 other major U.S. companies as it sought to identify policy proposals that could pave the way for more powerful robots, algorithms and the broader field of artificial intelligence. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Since 2017, however, the OSTP has lacked a full-time, Senate-confirmed leader. Its top-ranking official has been Michael Kratsios, who serves as the administration’s deputy chief technology officer. Kratsios joined the White House after working for Peter Thiel, a well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalist who supported the president’s election. The office has also employed fewer staffers than it did under Obama, prompting some Democrats on Capitol Hill last year to criticize the president. Veterans of the position said Droegemeier could be called to offer advice on a range of issues, from modernizing the inner workings of the government to addressing cyberthreats, perhaps including Russian efforts to spread disinformation online. Other early challenges include “working on the administration’s R&D budgets,” Holdren said, especially since Trump has proposed cutting some research spending outside the Pentagon. Previously, Droegemeier has spoken publicly about the need to sustain federal research spending.

The company projected that it would make $60 billion to $62 billion next quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations of $59.6 billion. The forecast is a measure of how well Apple thinks it can fare in a market where consumer interest in having the latest and greatest continues to wane. Apple, which makes about 56 percent of its revenue from the iPhone, has had to deal with slowing sales growth for its biggest product. The lure of faster, thinner, lighter phones used to send shoppers rushing to stores for the latest smartphones. But for the past couple of years, even premium smartphones have lost some appeal, and consumers are holding on to their phones for longer between upgrades. Samsung, Apple’s chief smartphone competitor, cited less-frequent upgrades as a reason its flagship models failed to deliver expected sales in its Monday earnings call. Its mobile unit reported a 22 percent drop in sales revenue to $20.2 billion, compared with the same time last year. Yet Apple fared far better than its rival. It sold 41.3 million iPhones, missing expectations for 41.8 million. But the iPhone unit delivered $29.9 billion in revenue, of an overall $53.2 billion. Apple reported $11.5 billion in profit, up from $8.7 billion in the third quarter of 2017. “Our Q3 results were driven by continued strong sales of iPhone, Services and Wearables,” chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. Shares rose nearly 3 percent in after-hours trading, from a $190.29 per share close — edging the company closer to its pursuit of a $1 trillion market value. Samsung and Apple have countered slowing sales growth by offering more expensive phones, which deliver greater profits. Yet that strategy has its pitfalls. In an earnings call, Samsung acknowledged it has to take a two-pronged approach to growing its mobile business. “We will also strengthen price competitiveness and actively develop advanced technology in our mass models to aggressively respond to market conditions,” Lee Kyeong-Tae, Samsung’s vice president of mobile communications, told investors Monday. [People aren't that into the Galaxy S9, Samsung's earnings show] Apple historically has kept its prices steady and its new premium phones at a premium price. But analysts expect that Apple will release three new models in the fall to diversify its offerings and convince those who did not upgrade to the iPhone 8 or the iPhone X that it’s time to buy a new phone. Smartphones still drive an enormous portion of both companies’ revenue, and the devices are still projected to generate $78 billion in 2018, according to a new estimate from the Consumer Technology Association. But Apple and Samsung are also eyeing other areas of their businesses for growth. Samsung has touted its growing chip business; semiconductors were its strongest category in terms of growth. Apple, meanwhile, has focused more on services such as the App Store and its entertainment businesses as growth drivers. In the past quarter, Apple’s services made $9.5 billion, making it the second-largest business segment for the firm. Apple’s Mac unit, which has been drawing complaints from consumers, reported a 5 percent drop in sales. The results show that Apple is positioned to keep its business growing despite slower smartphone sales, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and founder of Loup Ventures. “These numbers show us this is a franchise,” he said. Even when it comes to hardware, Munster said, the numbers prove Apple’s strategy is working. Apart from consumer behavior, there is also concern that Apple’s extensive overseas manufacturing operation may suffer from trade disputes between the United States and China. Analysts cautioned that it’s not yet clear how trade conflicts will affect the smartphone companies. In a note ahead of earnings, Andy Hargreaves of KeyBanc Capital Markets said that “the risk of a direct impact from trade conflicts or increased nationalism among foreign consumers that damages international iPhone demand” might offset potential gains for Apple, When asked about tariffs on an earnings call, Cook said that trade relationships are complex, but Apple considers tariffs to generally act as a “tax on the consumer,” and can lower economic growth and spark unintended consequences. Still, Cook played down fears of lasting consequences. “We’re optimistic, as I’ve been the whole time, that this will get sorted out because there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together,” he said. \", 'Slowing iPhone sales aren’t hurting Apple’s bottom line - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/facebook-says-it-has-uncovered-a-coordinated-disinformation-operation-ahead-of-the-2018-midterm-elections/2018/07/31/a57f10dc-a3e7-4d15-9bb7-249fd644ffa6_story.html': ('window.havePowaBoot=true;  by Elizabeth Dwoskin and Tony Romm July 31 at 7:00 PM Email the author   Facebook has shut down a sophisticated disinformation operation on its platform that engaged in divisive messaging ahead of the U.S. midterm elections, the company said Tuesday, an escalation of what a top executive described as an “arms race” to manipulate the public using its tools. Facebook said it discovered 32 false pages and profiles that were created between March 2017 and this May, which lured 290,000 people with ads, events and regular posts on topics such as race, fascism and feminism — and sought to stir opposition to President Trump. The company informed law enforcement before it deleted the profiles Tuesday morning. It also notified lawmakers of the activity this week, and said it would notify the real Facebook users who were swept up in the operation. One of the most popular pages had links to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the Kremlin-backed organization of Russian operatives that flooded Facebook with disinformation around the 2016 election, Facebook said. Yet the operators of the newly banned pages, whom Facebook said it was not in a position to identify, were more clever about covering their tracks. Lawmakers and experts were quick to attribute the activity to Russia. [‘Too easy to manipulate’: Russian disinformation finally costs Facebook and Twitter] The disclosure — the first admission of coordinated disinformation on Facebook that could affect the November election — is a sign that manipulation continues to be an active problem for Facebook and its billions of users, even after the company has spent heavily to prevent it. It also raised questions about whether other technology companies are still being used as conduits for disinformation, as Google, Twitter and others were around the last election. Google didn’t respond to queries about whether it has observed any new coordinated disinformation. Twitter declined to comment. Both Facebook and disinformation operators have become more savvy in the last year, since the company trickled out information about the IRA activity. Facebook, which detected the most recent pages through manual investigations, artificial intelligence and leads from law enforcement, has taken a more aggressive approach to rooting out and disclosing political abuse.    Facebook said it deleted pages such as Resisters after it found they violate a ban on coordinated inauthentic behavior. (Courtesy of Facebook)  The deceptive accounts have also modified their tactics to mask their identities. They used third parties to buy ads on their behalf and didn’t use Russian Internet protocol addresses or pay with Russian rubles, according to Facebook. And they relied heavily on promoting events, which Facebook doesn’t scrutinize as closely as ads on political or social issues. One such event was organized to counterprotest a far-right rally planned in Washington this month. “We’re sharing this today because of the timing of the event that was planned for Washington,” said Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who described the fight against disinformation as an “arms race” on a call with reporters Tuesday. She said the investigation was in an early stage but that she wanted to warn the public because the pages were promoting the counterprotest.         if(typeof window.powaBoot===\"function\")window.powaBoot();else{window.powaBootBoot=window.powaBootBoot||function(){if(null===document.querySelector(\\'script[src*\\\\x3d\"powaBoot.js\"]\\')){var script=document.createElement(\"script\");var scripts=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];script.src=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/player/prod/powaBoot.js?_\\\\x3d20180521B\";script.async=true;scripts.parentNode.insertBefore(script,scripts);window.havePowaBoot=true}};window.powaBootBoot()}; “It is clear that much more work needs to be done before the midterm elections to harden our defenses, because foreign bad actors are using the exact same playbook they used in 2016 — dividing us along political and ideological lines, to the detriment of our cherished democratic system,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. The new revelations could worsen Facebook\\'s political headaches in Washington, where the Senate Intelligence Committee is set to hold a hearing Wednesday on efforts to spread political discord on social media ahead of the 2018 midterms. In September, the congressional panel aims to hold another hearing with representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter, aides have said. Facebook last year revealed that the IRA had operated 470 accounts and pages on its main platform as well as its sister site, Instagram. Some of the content first surfaced in June 2015, and Russian-generated propaganda may have been seen by 126 million people, the company told the Senate. Some of the ads had been paid for in rubles, and some of the Internet addresses were traceable back to Russia, where the IRA operated out of St. Petersburg. In February, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III indicted 13 Russians for election interference, based on their manipulation of Facebook, Twitter and other social media. [Facebook takes down data and thousands of posts, obscuring reach of Russian disinformation] Facebook continued to sweep its site for further disinformation campaigns. In June, the company told The Washington Post that it hadn’t detected any Russian or IRA activity related to the midterms. Then last week, in a call discussing election integrity, the company appeared to hint that something had surfaced when it said it couldn’t discuss anything related to law enforcement investigations. Facebook executives said they discovered the pages in the past two weeks. In recent weeks, leaders in the administration, including Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, have said that active campaigns by Russia were taking place on social media. Trump has gone back and forth on whether Russia is still seeking to interfere in U.S. elections. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Department of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen on Tuesday applauded Facebook’s action. “This threat is very real, and Americans need to know that,” she said during an interview on Fox News Channel’s “The Daily Briefing.” Two clues tied the IRA to the 32 new accounts. Facebook found that one of the most popular pages, “Resisters,” briefly had a co-administrator — for seven minutes — that was a known IRA account before the co-administrator disappeared, according to Facebook. Another known IRA account had previously shared an event associated with the same page. Some of the Facebook pages existed as far back as March of last year, suggesting Facebook had missed some accounts in its initial sweep, which took place starting in early 2017 and continued through the fall. Facebook publicly named only four of the pages, suggesting that its understanding of the disinformation is still unfolding. It gave one research organization access to eight pages. [Facebook set up shop in Mexico to fight fake news ahead of the country\\'s election] In total, the operatives put out 9,500 Facebook posts. Other most-followed pages were “Aztlan Warriors,” “Black Elevation,” “Mindful Being” and “Ancestral Wisdom.” The most popular page had 18,000 followers — and the least popular, 16 followers. The 32 accounts ran 150 ads, which cost $11,000 and were paid for in U.S. and Canadian dollars. “Adversaries are not going to make sloppy mistakes,” said Renee DiResta, an expert on disinformation and research director at New Knowledge, a cybersecurity start-up. She called the new disinformation campaigns “increasingly complex.” Notably, they promoted 30 events, which can be more significant than ads because they seep into real life. The largest of the events, which Facebook hasn’t yet identified, had 4,700 accounts interested in attending, and 1,400 people registered to attend, Facebook said. The Black Elevation page also offered to hire people to promote their events, according to the files that Facebook released Tuesday. One Resisters event scheduled to take place last November in New York’s Times Square was called “Trump Nightmare Must End.” Four thousand Facebook users said they were interested in attending or would attend, according to images Facebook shared. It’s unclear if the event took place. Resisters, which described itself as a feminist group on Facebook written as reSisters, recently promoted an event called “No Unite the Right 2 DC.” The event, which was slated for August 10-12, was intended as a counterprotest to a planned far-right rally organized by supporters of the Charlottesville rally last summer. The counterprotest event had 2,600 people who said they were interested and 600 who said they would attend. Inauthentic administrators of the resisters page connected with administrators from five legitimate pages to co-host the event. Facebook said it notified those latter administrators. In the past year, Facebook has hired thousands of new security staff, partnered with research organizations, and improved its artificial intelligence tools for detecting disinformation. [Facebook lost more on July 27 than the entire value of Goldman Sachs. Or Lockheed Martin. Or Costco.] Facebook on Tuesday said its approach was to focus on forensics rather than make political statements about foreign governments. The issue of attribution to Russia has been a point of contention among executives. Facebook executives previously complained that law enforcement had not provided them with leads about Russian threats, but agencies said their hands were tied because of laws that prohibit domestic surveillance. In May, Facebook hosted a meeting with senior law enforcement officials to discuss the midterms, a sign that the relationship was getting warmer, The Washington Post reported. Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which received an advance copy of some of the pages from Facebook, said in a Medium post that, though it was too early to attribute the origin of the pages, “an initial scan shows behavioral patterns and use of language reminiscent of the troll operations run from Russia in 2014 through 2017.” Similar to the IRA pages around the election, the latest crop of pages were designed to build loyalty within a community through a shared identity that can later be manipulated. The Aztlan Warriors and Ancestral Wisdom pages focused on racial pride and anti-colonial messages for black, Hispanic and Native Americans, he pointed out. The latest pages, Brookie said, were more targeted to influence the current election cycle because “midterms tend to be more activist elections.” Here are some of the pages and posts that Facebook removed on Tuesday:    (Courtesy of Facebook)     (Courtesy of Facebook)  Clarification: The newly-discovered Facebook pages were created through May and operated until Tuesday morning.

(Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images)   by Peter Holley July 31 Email the author   The race to create self-driving trucks just got a little less crowded. That’s because Uber announced Monday that the ride-hailing giant is shuttering its self-driving truck program, a division that made history in 2016 by completing the world’s first autonomous truck delivery — 50,000 cans of Budweiser. That division — a part of Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group — had other successes as well, including delivering freight on highways in Arizona using automated Volvo big rigs. The robot-driven Volvo trucks were rolled out in November and included a human backup driver, the company said. The company did not have a formal partnership with Volvo but, instead, retrofitted Volvo trucks with its technology.  [Uber’s self-driving big rigs are already traveling across Arizona] Uber said that ending its self-driving truck program will allow the company to focus on its self-driving car program, which the company is moving to relaunch on public roads. Uber’s self-driving car program was suspended in March after a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz., was struck and killed by one of Uber’s driverless vehicles, leading to a National Transportation Safety Board investigation. “We recently took the important step of returning to public roads in Pittsburgh, and as we look to continue that momentum, we believe having our entire team’s energy and expertise focused on this effort is the best path forward,” Eric Meyhofer, head of Uber Advanced Technologies Group, said in a statement.  Uber Freight — a smartphone app that links truck drivers to freight — will continue, the company said, noting that it remains one of Uber’s most promising businesses, one that has tripled in size in little more than a year. The company says it does not need to immediately develop self-driving trucks to remain a competitive force in the world of freight logistics. The company plans to shift employees currently focused on self-driving trucks to other parts of its self-driving technology programs. Uber’s self-driving truck program faced competition from a number of companies, including Tesla and Waymo — formerly known as Google’s self-driving car project — which began hauling cargo in Atlanta in March. Waymo said its technology would power Peterbilt Class 8 trucks to carry cargo bound for Google’s data centers. The company’s engineers have been testing self-driving trucks in California and Arizona, the same state where a fleet of 600 autonomous Waymo taxis have been on the roads without a human driver since November, the company said in a blog post. “Our software is learning to drive big rigs in much the same way a human driver would after years of driving passenger cars,” Waymo said in the post. “The principles are the same, but things like braking, turning, and blind spots are different with a fully-loaded truck and trailer.”  A Florida start-up called Starsky Robotics intends to make driverless deliveries in the company’s trucks by the end of 2018, according to Wired. Another start-up, called Embark, drove an automated truck across the country without a driver, completing a 2,400-mile journey from California to Florida.

The summer is always a bit quiet for smartphone makers as they prepare to launch new phones for the fall. But sales for Samsung were down even for the traditionally low-key quarter, as its flagship phones struggled to outshine the iPhone X and iPhone 8. Samsung’s mobile communications vice president, Lee Kyeong-Tae, acknowledged in an earnings call that sales of its flagship Galaxy S9 and S9+ had been “weaker than expected,” as his unit reported a 22 percent drop in sales revenue to $20.2 billion. He pointed to a couple of reasons for the results. People are holding on to their high-end smartphones for longer periods of time between upgrades, Lee said, meaning fewer people are rushing out to buy flashy new models each year. Samsung globally is also facing competition on its less expensive phones from Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei and Xiaomi. Samsung’s mobile business accounts for nearly 40 percent of the company’s sales. To offset slowdowns in mobile, the company has touted its growing sales of chips, which it manufacturers for itself and other smartphone makers, including Apple. Semiconductors were its strongest category in terms of growth, up 25 percent from the same time last year. Overall, the company reported $13.3 billion in profit, up 6 percent from the same time last year, on $52.1 billion in revenue. It was Samsung’s slowest profit growth for the company in more than a year. The smartphone market overall has been down this year, with shipments slipping 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from the same period last year, according to market intelligence firm IDC. Samsung, while still the world’s largest smartphone maker, saw its shipments down 2.4 percent in the first quarter, IDC reported in May. “Looking forward, more affordable premium devices might be the solution the market needs in the second half of the year to drive shipments back in a positive direction,” IDC research manager Anthony Scarsella said at the time. Samsung appears to be taking that idea to heart. During the call with investors, executives promised that the Note 9, a new addition to Samsung’s large-screened phone line, “offers exceptional performance for a reasonable price.” It will also debut a few weeks earlier than usual — a New York launch event is planned for Aug. 9 — which Robert Yi, executive vice president for investor relations, said was part of a strategy to “address rising competition.” The company also promised to come back in the next smartphone generation with something more exciting. “We expect 5G and new form factors to bring new energy to the market. We will be preparing easily to tap this breakthrough technology,” Lee told analysts during the earnings call. The reference to “form factors” could be an allusion to Samsung’s work on flexible screens, which it first teased at the CES technology show in 2013. That work has fueled rumors of a foldable smartphone from Samsung for years. With the 10th model of the Galaxy S series coming up, many analysts say we may see the company’s first attempt at a foldable phone to make the milestone. \", 'People aren’t that into the Galaxy S9, Samsung’s earnings show - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/france-bans-smartphones-in-school/2018/07/31/087a14be-daff-4d7c-9297-a7bf19c2cc80_story.html': ('A student takes a photo on a smartphone after reading his exam results at a school in Paris.

French lawmakers on Monday passed legislation banning students as old as 15 from bringing smartphones and tablets to school, or at least requiring that they be turned off, according to the Agence France-Presse. Officials in support of the new rule described the policy as a way to shield children from addictive habits and to safeguard the sanctity of the classroom. “We know today that there is a phenomenon of screen addiction, the phenomenon of bad mobile-phone use,” education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer told French news channel BFMTV, according to CNN. “Our main role is to protect children and adolescents. It is a fundamental role of education, and this law allows it.” The law, however, makes exceptions for educational use, extracurricular activities and for students with disabilities, the AFP reports. French high schools can choose to impose a less-stringent ban on Internet-connected devices. Even before the new policy was voted in, French law prohibited students from using their phones while class was in session. But during the 2017 French presidential election, Emmanuel Macron pledged to impose a school ban on phones entirely. This isn’t the first French law designed to beat back the encroachment of digital technology in everyday life. Last year the government passed a law requiring French companies to draft rules that limited work emails and work-related technology outside the office. Dubbed the “right to disconnect,” French officials said the legislation aimed to reduce job-related stress and prevent employee burnout. \"Employees physically leave the office, but they do not leave their work.

A pair of ugly earnings reports last week underscored their struggles to overcome Russia’s attempts to manipulate U.S. voters during the 2016 presidential election. The resulting stock declines, which continued into this week, amounted to a hit of more than $100 billion for a technology industry that long has been key to gains by the U.S. economy and Wall Street. Though the reasons for their disappointing earnings differ in their details, in both cases the companies have been compelled to act by Capitol Hill to prevent a recurrence of the Russian interference. That action has proved expensive — in terms of hiring new staff to review content for Facebook and in efforts to suspend fake accounts for Twitter, which has had the inadvertent effect of driving down a crucial count of the company’s active users. Both also have been the target of a public backlash against the expansive role of social media in American life, a trend fueled by allegations that Facebook and Twitter should have been more aggressive in preventing the Russian disinformation and taken even more forceful corrective measures afterward. [How years of privacy controversies finally caught up with Facebook] “People are angry with the platforms,” said Clint Watts, a former FBI agent and Foreign Policy Research Institute senior fellow who studies disinformation. “They built a system where it was too easy to manipulate.” The Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, owned by an ally of Vladimir Putin, controlled 270 pages and accounts on Facebook and nearly 4,000 accounts on Twitter, which the companies revealed last fall. A third company used by the Russians, Google, has weathered the aftermath more easily. Its parent company, Alphabet, posted strong earnings last week. Even Facebook and Twitter suffered little obvious impact to their profitability after the first disclosures of the interference. But the costs affiliated with their corporate response have become increasingly clear. Facebook significantly lowered its revenue projections last week, citing privacy missteps, new regulations in Europe and increased investments in security. Those new investments in safety and security include the development of artificial intelligence technology that can spot bad accounts and staff increases of 20,000 people by the end of the year, according to the company’s latest projections. A Facebook executive disclosed in a call with reporters last week that such efforts to combat disinformation and other political abuse are still largely “manual” and not automated — meaning that for the foreseeable future they will rely heavily on individual staff members to conduct reviews. The growing head count — up 47 percent from the previous year — is a significant expense, said Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner. Investors who for years had been bullish on Facebook were stunned by the lowered predictions: The stock suffered the largest single-day drop in Wall Street history. A day later, Twitter said it lost a million monthly users in the second quarter and expects to see further declines, paying a price for an aggressive new campaign to suspend fake and suspicious accounts, the type the Russians used. In response, Twitter’s stock closed down 21 percent Friday. The report offered the most definitive evidence yet that the company’s efforts are having a measurable impact on Twitter’s ability to attract and maintain active users — a key metric in Wall Street’s assessments of the company. [Twitter is sweeping out fake accounts like never before, putting user growth at risk] Google is the only major tech company Russia used as a conduit for misinformation to have avoided a major reversal in its stock price. Its shares surged in the past week after a strong earnings report — despite a $5.1 billion fine imposed by European antitrust regulators. The perception of technology companies has shifted dramatically since last year, notably with revelations last fall that Russian operatives from the Internet Research Agency flooded Facebook and Twitter with bots and fake accounts to spread divisive narratives ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Politicians on both sides of the aisle, from Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), have questioned whether social media platforms are good for democracy, for health and for the economy as a whole — and have raised the prospect of more regulation of the industry. One reason the financial consequence is showing up now, instead of right after the Russia hearings in Congress last fall, is that it takes time to rev up hiring and start new initiatives within companies. Twitter’s work accelerated this spring, after news reports revealed that Twitter’s fake-follower problems were much greater than before, and the company completed the testing phase of new artificial intelligence tools that can detect thousands of signals and make automated decisions in order to sweep large numbers of accounts. The formal launch of those tools was in May, shortly after the company’s last quarterly earnings. Facebook began new technological efforts to go after disinformation right after the 2016 election. But the wave of hiring and the financial forecasts of lower revenue didn’t start until the company reported third-quarter earnings last November, which took place the same day as the hearings. “I’ve directed our teams to invest so much in security — on top of the other investments we’re making — that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward, and I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me,” Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said at the time. But investors largely ignored the CEO’s warning because Facebook’s business was so good. The company surpassed more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, blowing past investors’ financial targets for the company. Over the past eight months, however, Facebook has faced two additional hurdles that were a tipping point for the company, analysts said: The Cambridge Analytica controversy and a new privacy law in Europe that significantly affects targeted advertising, the company’s main source of revenue. The Cambridge revelations, which showed that a Trump-affiliated consultancy had inappropriately obtained the private profiles of tens of millions of Facebook users, shed light on Facebook’s lax protections and has caused a crisis of public trust in the company. The result is that Facebook has been pushed to make further investments in privacy that limit its ability to collect data for targeted ads. In addition to the financial impact, the drop in stock value can hurt morale and cause retention and recruitment problems at technology companies, where workers receive a significant portion of their compensation through stock options, said Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook and Google who has become a critic of the social network. Facebook employees in particular are motivated by the idea that the company is good for the world, and the 2016 election has already caused serious questioning among workers. The falling stock was a major point of discussion among Facebook employees who use the workplace chat app Blind last week, according to comments in a public chat room reviewed by The Washington Post.

Under the new guidelines, the companies said they would obtain consumers\\' “separate express consent” before turning over their individual genetic information to businesses and other third parties, including insurers. They also said they would disclose the number of law-enforcement requests they receive each year. The new commitments come roughly three months after local investigators used a DNA-comparison service to track down a man police believed to be the Golden State Killer, who allegedly raped and killed dozens of women in California in the 1970s and 1980s. Investigators identified the suspect using a decades-old DNA sample obtained from the crime scene, which they uploaded to GEDmatch, a crowdsourced database of roughly a million distinct DNA sets shared by volunteers. Investigators said they did not need a court order before using GEDmatch, sparking fresh fears that users’ biological data might be too easy to access — and could end up in the wrong hands — without additional regulation on the fast-growing, already popular industry. Yet adherence to the rules is voluntary. While the policy offers users of participating sites added new protections at a time of great “uncertainty,” it doesn’t have the force of law, said Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at Consumers Union. “In general, I think there should be stronger transparency requirements and legally binding rules for everyone around the transfer and use of super sensitive data like this,” he said. Jules Polonetsky, the leader of the Future of Privacy Forum, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that helped companies draft the new privacy guidelines, said his organization’s work began months before the Golden State Killer incident. But he said hopes the blueprint can serve as a “first effort at showing the sector what the right way to handle some of these challenges is.”  \"I don\\'t think the average consumer has wrapped their head around the range of issues they should think about when they make a decision to share [DNA] data,” Polonetsky added. [Data on a genealogy site led police to the ‘Golden State Killer’ suspect. Now others worry about a ‘treasure trove of data’] Consumer DNA testing services have surged in popularity in recent years: One report from research firm Kalorama Information estimates the market could triple in value from $99 million to $310 million by 2022. The growth has been spurred on by the federal government, which recently opened the door for 23andMe to sell consumers genetic tests that could be used to inform them of their likely risk for contracting certain diseases. And the industry has been supercharged with fresh investment amid heightened interest from academics and drugmakers who hope to tap DNA databases in search of new health insights and cures. Last week, 23andMe announced it had struck a research deal with GlaxoSmithKline, which would see the pharmaceutical giant invest $300 million in the genomics company. As part of that pact, GlaxoSmithKline can access “de-identified” genetic data about 23andMe users — provided they’ve previously given their consent — so that the firm can “gather insights and discover novel drug targets driving disease progression,” the company said. Under the “best practices” adopted by 23andMe and its peers, such sharing is permitted. GlaxoSmithKline is “not getting any direct access or receiving any sort of individual customer information,” said Kate Black, the global privacy officer for 23andMe, just insights about broad chunks of users and their medical traits. The DNA testing company also said it previously had asked users\\' permission to participate in research, and it estimates 80 percent of its users agree to take part in such studies. Other companies — Helix, MyHeritage, Habit, African Ancestry and FamilyTreeDNA — pledged Tuesday to adopt a similar approach, the Future of Privacy Forum said. When it comes to health research, they said they would explain the “risks, benefits and purpose of the research” to consumers, while providing easy-to-read privacy policies, according to the new guidelines. [Opinion: The creepy, dark side of DNA databases] Customers of these DNA testing services would gain some limited rights to have their biological data deleted, but they may not be able to withdraw data that was already in use by researchers. Companies, meanwhile, would have to ensure the person submitting DNA data is the actual owner of that data. “Because privacy is such a hot topic, and consumers are concerned about privacy, this is the equivalent of peer pressure,” said Elissa Levin, who leads policy and clinical services at Helix, a company that connects consumers with apps that analyze genome data. “I think it’ll really be an opportunity to start to have true clarity and transparency between the good players and the not-so-good players.”  Yet users still may not know everything. Under the industry-made rules, DNA testing services don’t have to tell their consumers every time their data has been stripped of their identity, combined with others\\' genetic information, combed for insights, then turned into statistics, and perhaps shared with a third party for further analysis. While companies have said they will report each year on the law-enforcement requests they receive, users might not learn about the legal demands if investigators obtain gag orders. Companies like Ancestry and 23andMe have committed to “attempt to notify” their customers about such requests whenever they can. Moreover, the tool tapped by investigators in the Golden State Killer case, GEDmatch, is an open-source database that isn’t covered by the industry’s new best practices. Those that promise to protect consumers\\' sensitive personal data — then fail to adhere to those promises — could invite penalties from the Federal Trade Commission. “The FTC remains vigilant in protecting consumers’ privacy and security. If companies fail to keep their promises to consumers — whether they made those promises in website privacy policies or by signing onto industry best practices — they could be subject to FTC law enforcement action,” said spokeswoman Juliana Gruenwald Henderson. [DNA testing service MyHeritage says 92 million customer email addresses were exposed] A few companies already adhere to some of the new industry-made rules. Ancestry and 23andMe, for example, currently report to users the law enforcement requests they receive. In 2017, Ancestry received 34 valid law enforcement requests — all related to credit card or identity theft — and provided data in 31 cases. At 23andMe, the company received five requests but turned over user data on none of them.

(Richard Drew/AP)   by Hamza Shaban July 30 Email the author   Days after Facebook’s stock suffered the largest drop in Wall Street history, a shareholder sued the company, accusing the social media network of making misleading statements about its user numbers and operations. The plaintiff, James Kacouris, filed the lawsuit Friday seeking class-action status and to recover damages. Kacouris alleged that Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, violated federal securities laws by misleading shareholders about the company’s number of active users and the slowing growth of its revenue. Kacouris also named Facebook chief financial officer David Wehner in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Facebook said in its earnings report last week that it anticipated slower revenue growth and slimmer margins in the future, in part to improve the safety and privacy of the platform. That forecast ignited a massive Wall Street sell-off that dragged the company’s market value down by more than $100 billion. That was the largest single-day drop in Wall Street history. “Facebook’s announcements shocked the marketplace,” Kacouris said in the complaint. He alleges that Facebook’s “wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” have resulted in significant losses and damages for him and other shareholders. Facebook declined to comment. Zuckerberg reiterated in the earnings call last week that the company’s major investments in security will lower its profitability. “We’re starting to see that this quarter,” he said, adding, “We run this company for the long term, not for the next quarter.\" The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on the shareholder lawsuit. Facebook reported for the first time that 2.5 billion people around the world use at least one of its applications, including Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram and the core Facebook service. But the costs of improving the flagship platform have risen dramatically. The company said its total expenses have increased 50 percent from the same time last year, from about $4.9 billion to $7.4 billion. Investors were also told that its sales growth is expected to slow. Facebook anticipates that the rate of its rising costs will exceed its revenue growth by next year. Facebook faces another investor lawsuit filed this year. Investors sued Facebook accusing the company of misleading shareholders over a data privacy scandal involving political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which improperly accessed the information from 87 million people. Multiple federal agencies, including the SEC are investigating the matter. The probe focuses on Facebook’s knowledge of the misuse of data three years ago, and why the company did not disclose it to users or investors at the time. The scrutiny by the SEC, Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and the FBI also centers on any discrepancies in Facebook’s recent explanations. Twitter, another prominent social media company grappling with safety issues, also saw its stock plummet last week. The company said it lost 1 million monthly active users in an earnings call Friday, a signal that efforts to rid its platform of fake and suspicious accounts will come at a cost.

The order from the New York Public Service Commission accuses Charter of “persistent actions demonstrating bad faith,” claiming that the company has repeatedly failed to live up to promises it made during the merger approval process to connect more New Yorkers to high-speed Internet. The decision cuts against a broader nationwide trend of consolidation in the telecom and media industries, although it is limited to New York state and does not cover the more than 40 other states in which Charter does business, including Kentucky, Montana or Texas. The combined Charter-Time Warner Cable operation is the second-largest cable company in the country. [AT&T-Time Warner merger approved, setting the stage for more consolidation across corporate America] Under the order, Charter has 60 days to come up with a “transition” plan complying with the commission’s decision. But the order contains few specifics, and the company could still seek to challenge it in court. Charter had agreed to bring its broadband network to 145,000 unserved or underserved homes in New York as a condition of its acquisition of Time Warner Cable. But, the commission said, Charter soon missed its first deadline to expand its network to an additional 36,250 homes by May 2017. Charter agreed to a series of revised targets with regulators. But when it provided its next update in December, commission officials said Charter did not deserve credit for more than 18,000 households it said it had connected, in part because many of them appeared to be located in New York City and not a hard-to-reach, less densely populated area. Charter objected, saying that the commission was seeking to add new requirements the company had never agreed to and that the effort to disqualify the homes was groundless. In a statement Friday, Charter — which offers service in New York state as Spectrum — implied that the commission’s order may have been politically motivated. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) has not shied away from criticizing Charter for its delays; in May, he foreshadowed regulators' decision by saying the public service commission had initiated “legal action” against the company. Cuomo faces off against challenger Cynthia Nixon in the Sept. 13 Democratic gubernatorial primary. “In the weeks leading up to an election, rhetoric often becomes politically charged,” Charter said in its statement. “But the fact is that Spectrum has extended the reach of our advanced broadband network to more than 86,000 New York homes and businesses since our merger agreement with the PSC. Our 11,000 diverse and locally based workers, who serve millions of customers in the state every day, remain focused on delivering faster and better broadband to more New Yorkers, as we promised.” \", 'New York moves to break up Charter’s merger with Time Warner Cable - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/a-teen-allegedly-broke-into-a-couples-home-he-asked-them-for-the-wifi-password-police-say/2018/07/27/36f40bce-4045-4c38-8ff1-e72248745308_story.html': ('(iStock)   by Lindsey Bever July 27 Email the author   A 17-year-old has been accused of breaking into a couple’s home in Northern California and asking for their WiFi password, hours after he had asked nearby neighbors for theirs, authorities said.

The male resident “pushed him down the hallway and out the front door of the house before calling police,” police said in a statement. Palo Alto Police Sgt.

(Jennifer McDermott/AP)   by Peter Holley July 27 Email the author   Once an electric scooter has been released into the urban wild, its life might best be likened to that of a medieval serf — backbreaking labor followed by the strong possibility of an ignominious end. Scooters that reach their expiration date after being worn down merely by inclement weather, overuse and hazardous potholes are the lucky ones. Many others can expect their final moments to be undeniably barbaric. Some face death by bonfire, and others are flung into the ocean or tossed from the top of parking garages and bridges, shattering on concrete sidewalks or disappearing into murky waters below. Scooters have also been intentionally run over by trucks or torn apart — limb by electronic limb — by angry drunks and rage-filled teenagers screaming abusive epithets. At one point, a San Francisco repair shop was inundated with as many as 100 scooters a day, forcing owner Michael Ghadieh to hire three new mechanics. “The angry people, they were angry,” Ghadieh told CNET. “People cut cables, flatten tires, they were thrown in the bay. Someone was out there physically damaging these things.” [Electric-scooter companies conquer with a simple strategy: Act first, answer questions later] Ghadieh said scooter vandalism has slowed in San Francisco, but it appears to be continuing as scooter companies parachute into cities across the country ahead of regulations, often taking the public and local officials by surprise. Euwyn Poon, co-founder of the scooter company Spin, infuriated critics in a recent on-camera interview with Vice when he described this strategy as “innovating on the regulatory side.\" For the past month or so, all manner of scooter executions have been catalogued by “Birdgraveyard,” an Instagram account whose 14,000 followers relish — in mob-like fashion — the destruction of the battery-powered contraptions.

The scooters are not “last mile” transportation solutions, they argue, so much as the greedy tentacles of Silicon Valley brands wrapping themselves around public sidewalks. Others consider the scooters symbols of a troubling shift from public to “private” transportation, a change that places important decisions about how cities operate in the hands of multibillion-dollar companies thousands of miles away. For still others, destroying scooters offers a nihilistic release. “Smashing scooters is just funny,” the account administrators of Birdgraveyard told Vice. “It’s amusing when people come to the page and do not get why it’s funny. If you can’t laugh at a ride-share scooter being lit on fire at a house party, that’s a problem with you. There’s nothing in the Constitution that says we all have to respect and love brands.” [Electric scooters might revolutionize urban transport — if it wasn’t for humans] Not surprisingly, scooter companies disagree. Although companies declined to release data about the average life span of their products — which differs depending on terrain, market and usage — they say they do applaud when people report vandalism of their products and when law enforcement investigates. “We do not support the vandalism or destruction of any property and are disappointed when it takes place,” the scooter company Bird said in a statement. “Nor do we support the encouragement, celebration or normalization of this behavior.”  Lime, another scooter company, said its bikes and scooters are equipped with GPS mapping technology, making it easy to track their location if the company suspects a scooter has been stolen or vandalized. Lime noted that its products also contain sensors that are able to track when someone is trying to tamper with the device. [Review: LimeBike’s new dockless scooters are a whimsical ride but not a practical one] “Lime does not tolerate vandalism of any kind,” the company said in a statement. “If anyone witnesses a potential incident of vandalism, we ask that they please immediately report it so our team can take the appropriate measures.” “Out of the 35,000+ scooters and bikes Lime has across the country, only a few have been vandalized, which is consistent with the low rate of vandalism and theft — less than 1 percent — we experience nationwide,” the statement added. Yet, scooter companies may not need their products to live a long life to make money off them.

Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, participate in an American Technology Council roundtable at the White House on June 19, 2017. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)   by Tony Romm July 27 Email the author   The Trump administration is crafting a proposal to protect Web users’ privacy, aiming to blunt global criticism that the absence of strict federal rules in the United States has enabled data mishaps at Facebook and others in Silicon Valley. Over the past month, the Commerce Department has been huddling with representatives of tech giants such as Facebook and Google, Internet providers including AT&T and Comcast, and consumer advocates, according to four people familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak on the record. The government’s goal is to release an initial set of ideas this fall that outlines Web users’ rights, including general principles for how companies should collect and handle consumers’ private information, the people said. The forthcoming blueprint could then become the basis for Congress to write the country’s first wide-ranging online-privacy law, an idea the White House recently has said it could endorse. \"Through the White House National Economic Council, the Trump Administration aims to craft a consumer privacy protection policy that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,” Lindsay Walters, the president’s deputy press secretary, said in a statement. “We look forward to working with Congress on a legislative solution consistent with our overarching policy.” If history is any guide, the process could prove politically grueling. Intense disagreements between Democrats and Republicans over the need for government regulation — on top of well-funded lobbying efforts by tech giants such as Facebook and Google — long have forestalled progress on even the simplest attempts to improve privacy online. This time, however, advocates for stronger privacy protections say the odds are in their favor — especially because California implemented privacy rules in June in the face of federal inaction. The risk that other states might follow California’s lead has prompted some once-recalcitrant tech and telecom firms to cooperate with federal regulators. In the United States, there is no single federal law that controls how companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter collect and monetize Web data. The absence of a national standard has become more glaring in recent months as other governments — including the European Union — have adopted tough new rules targeting tech companies. Adding to the headaches are some major missteps, particularly at Facebook, which is under investigation for its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, the data consultancy that worked for the Trump campaign and improperly accessed the personal information of about 87 million people. The incident prompted Congress to summon Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for two hearings this spring in which Democrats and Republicans mused aloud if they should consider regulating the industry more aggressively. Even Zuckerberg admitted some regulation of tech giants might be necessary. One official at the White House said this week that recent developments “have been seismic in the privacy policy world,” prompting the government to discuss what a modern U.S. approach to privacy protection might look like. So far, the Trump administration has held 22 meetings with more than 80 companies, trade associations and consumer groups since late June, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, one of the entities involved in the effort. Axios first reported some early details of the government’s plans. Privacy hawks have told the Commerce Department that they should turn to Europe for inspiration. In May, the E.U. began mandating that tech companies obtain users’ permission before collecting their data, while granting consumers new rights to download or delete their information — and violators could face hefty fines. Major companies such as Facebook and Google since then have adapted some of their practices even beyond the borders of the E.U. to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. “The reality is that there are a number of obligations under the GDPR that U.S. companies are already meeting,” said Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology. Meanwhile, U.S. businesses are pushing the Trump administration to articulate a vision for privacy that’s less aggressive than that of Europe, participants in the talks say. In a sign the government shares some of those views, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross previously called GDPR an impediment to international commerce. One draft proposal from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, obtained by The Washington Post, calls for privacy protections balanced against “the benefits provided by data.” While endorsing the idea that consumers generally should have more choice over how their information is used, the document appears to ward off some punishment for privacy abuses, including lawsuits from people whose data have been mishandled. The Chamber specifically calls on Congress to adopt a law that “preempts” states so that local legislatures across the country don’t try to adopt their own potentially tougher privacy rules. There’s a clear target of the Chamber’s proposal: California. Last month, policymakers in the Golden State passed an expansive law that would allow consumers to learn what is collected about them and opt out of having their data sold to third parties, including advertisers. Privacy advocates cheered the law, which takes effect in 2020; tech giants spent big in a failed bid to defeat it. The U.S. Chamber declined to discuss its proposal, but spokeswoman Katharine Cooksey said in a statement that the aim is to “develop policy recommendations that are thoughtful, tailored, and done correctly for consumers and businesses.” Yet some consumer advocates are wary of stripping states of their power to regulate privacy, given that California and its peers often have moved much faster to tackle major digital ills than gridlocked federal lawmakers. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said it could be a “non-starter for consumer organizations.” Six years ago, then-President Barack Obama embarked on a similar effort. His administration unveiled a consumer privacy “bill of rights” in 2012 that called on companies to be transparent about their data-collection practices while giving consumers more control over how their information is used. The Obama administration pledged to “work with Congress to develop legislation based on these rights,” it said at the time. In the end, though, the efforts collapsed. Organizations representing Facebook and Google lobbied extensively against new rules that would regulate how they serve ads targeted to Web users\\' behaviors and interests. They and other tech companies warred with privacy groups, who at one point stormed out of the government’s attempts to broker a compromise. Congress never even came close to legislating, and it took Obama’s team three years before it even released a draft online-privacy bill. This time, veterans of those fights insist the stakes — and the politics — have changed. “If [the Trump administration] did their version of the privacy bill of rights, and did the necessary legwork to make sure there was a constituency to support it, I think it would be a meaningful step forward … motivating Congress to act,” said Dean Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents tech giants including Apple, Facebook and Google. “What’s happened in Europe, what’s happened around the world, what’s happened with Cambridge Analytica — it’s a very different world,” he said.

The earnings report was Twitter’s first since The Washington Post reported three weeks ago that the company was suspending accounts at a rate of roughly 1 million a day after implementing new tools for detecting accounts that might be involved in disinformation or other activity, such as spam, not permitted on the platform. Twitter had 335 million average monthly active users in the second quarter, down from 336 million the previous quarter. The company said that its monthly user numbers would continue to decline in the third quarter, expecting the drop to be in the “single-digit millions.”  Twitter’s stock closed down 21 percent Friday — though it has still more than doubled in the last year. Company executives had acknowledged their new tactics against suspicious accounts but said the impact on active users was likely to be limited because most of the suspended accounts were either not active or newly created. Friday’s report offered the most definitive evidence yet that the company’s efforts are having a measurable impact on Twitter’s ability to attract and maintain active users — the key metric in the company’s valuation by Wall Street. The 1 million loss came from users in the United States, the company said. Twitter has warned investors that new investments in security and safety will affect user metrics. This month, many high-profile Twitter users, including President Trump and former president Barack Obama, saw a significant drop in their follower counts. The company purged followers that had been frozen or locked for security reasons, sometimes for long periods of time, but had been included in follower counts. [Here's why Trump, Obama and other high-profile Twitter users could see a ‘significant drop’ in followers] Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said the company prioritizes the long-term health of the platform over short-term metrics. “We believe that Twitter’s value as a daily service is enhanced when the conversation on the platform is healthier and people feel safe freely expressing themselves.”  Twitter’s aggressive moves to clean up the platform has not detracted from its advertising revenue, said the social network’s Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal during a conference call. “Advertisers embrace the work we are doing,” he said, adding that “they recognize that a healthier Twitter, as opposed to a disclosed metric, is what’s going to deliver a great result for them.”  The news comes after Facebook lost more than $100 billion in value following a disappointing earnings report Wednesday. That company is battling privacy controversies and rising regulation in Europe while also implementing costly new measures to battle disinformation on its platform. The combined impact of two leading tech companies stumbling in the same week could make investors wary of an industry whose growth has been key to the economy and stock market for years. Google parent company Alphabet, however, is having a strong week after reported earnings on Monday. [Facebook lost more yesterday than the entire value of Goldman Sachs. Or Lockheed Martin. Or Costco.] Twitter beat expectations for revenue, reporting $711 million in sales. That’s up 24 percent year-over-year, the company said. Financial analysts had estimated revenue to come in at $698 million. The social media company also had its third consecutive profitable quarter. Social media researchers for years had complained about the prevalence of bots — automated accounts managed by people seeking to shape online discourse — on Twitter, accusing the company of playing down the problem and not doing enough to curtail their influence. Twitter escalated its battle against suspicious accounts late last year in the face of congressional and public pressure following revelations about how Russia used the platform to spread disinformation to shape the 2016 presidential campaign in favor of Republican Donald Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. The company implemented new tools, including one called Operation Megaphone, that involved quietly buying fake accounts and seeking to detect connections among them. Using its new tactics, the social media company suspended more than 1 million accounts a day in May and June and is slated to have kept that pace through July. The company has more than doubled its rate of suspensions since last year. “It’s becoming obvious that they have done something about the presence of fake accounts on their platform,” said Jonathan Albright, a social media researcher for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “The problem was bad, and it did go on for way too long.”  The campaign has drawn some complaints from users, especially conservatives who have accused Twitter of singling them out in an effort to limit their free expression. The company has said its efforts to battle fake and suspicious accounts has been nonpartisan. The earnings call did not touch on a new looming issue for the company, which President Trump tweeted about Thursday. Trump accused the social media company of trying to silence prominent conservatives on the platform. The president appeared to seize on a Vice report that said that the accounts of some conservatives did not show up in auto-populated search suggestions when people typed in their names.   Twitter “SHADOW BANNING” prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2018    Twitter said in a blog post Thursday that it does not “shadow ban” users, and that the issue of auto-populated search results had affected hundreds of thousands of accounts but did not target users by political affiliation. The issue, Twitter said, probably stemmed from its systems detecting coordinated behavior by communities seeking to boost each other’s presence on the platform, which caused the names not to appear in the auto-suggested search. Twitter said the issue has been resolved.

Privately, the White House has indicated to Capitol Hill that Trump has decided to put off a shutdown until after the elections, according to a source familiar with the discussions who asked for anonymity so that they could speak freely. But Trump’s comments Wednesday underscored the uncertainty that always surrounds what the president may do on any issue. “I’ve had a lot of good support within the Republican Party, and you saw the poll numbers in the Republican Party. They like me, so I have to keep them a little bit happy,” Trump said. “But whether it’s before or after? But I actually think it’s a great campaign issue. I think it would be great before. But I don’t want to disappoint a lot of very good people that are working with me.” As Trump made his remarks Wednesday, the Senate passed its latest batch of spending bills, as the annual process of funding the government moved along at an unusually rapid clip compared to the dysfunction of recent years. GOP senators are working to give Trump what he’s said he wants — individual pieces of legislation to sign, instead of a massive year-end package he’s threatened to veto. “When we finish this process I think the president will feel differently about shutting down government.

But the “controlled chaos” was a bit more relaxed than usual, insisted one Tesla official. The factory was still running through the night as part of a weeks-long sprint, but workers were finding a rhythm: One engineer said he even got a recent Sunday off. Normal for the youngest, most erratic U.S. automaker has always looked like insanity anywhere else. The Silicon Valley giant on Wednesday will report earnings that analysts expect could include $900\\xa0million of losses in the second quarter, a time of factory disasters and internal paranoia that Musk, Tesla’s billionaire chief, has described as “the most excruciating, hellish several months I’ve maybe ever had.” But as investors scrutinize how quickly cash is burning at Tesla, the ambitious $50\\xa0billion automaker that has not made a profit in 15 years, another risk is also becoming more apparent: whether the company’s frenetic pace is leading to widespread burnout for Tesla employees — and, perhaps, even Musk himself.          window.havePowaBoot=true; The famously unpredictable company still has legions of fans and plenty of reasons to stay upbeat. Its newest car, the Model 3, has debuted to massive fanfare and raves from reviewers calling it a “modern marvel,” “highway assassin” and “pure jungle cat.” The company in early July celebrated a long-delayed production milestone, building 5,000 of the cars a week; sustained production could pleasantly surprise investors and, as Musk likes to say, prove the haters wrong. [Elon Musk’s ‘pedo’ attack rattles Tesla investors: ‘This thing is unraveling’] Such quarterly earnings announcements are for most companies typically clinical affairs, but Tesla’s are known for their fireworks. During the last call, in May, Musk berated analysts for asking questions he called “boring,” “bonehead,” “so dry” and “not cool.” Tesla’s stock this week is down 20\\xa0percent from its June peak. Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures who said Musk’s recent fights on Twitter had raised questions about his “maturity,” wrote in a note to investors Monday that he expected “a more measured Elon Musk” on the upcoming earnings call. A repeat of Musk’s last performance, he added, would mean “a material loss of investor confidence.” Tesla retains the ignoble honor of being the most shorted on Wall Street, with more investors betting against Musk’s carmaker than any other company. Among them is Steve Eisman, whose bets against subprime mortgages were chronicled in “The Big Short” and who last week said of Musk: “Being smart’s not enough. You’ve got to execute. And he’s got execution problems.”    The Tesla Factory in Fremont. (Mason Trinca for The Washington Post)  The company, which said last quarter that it had about $3\\xa0billion of cash on hand, will have to pay off or refinance more than $1\\xa0billion in bond payments coming due over the next year. And over the past month, investors have raced to cash in on Tesla’s potential doom, with surges in trading of credit default swaps — financial instruments that will pay out if Tesla fails to pay its debts. Musk has pledged that Tesla will be profitable in the second half of the year if it can keep producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week. The carmaker hit that goal during a week-long manufacturing sprint in late June and is expected to tell shareholders Wednesday whether it kept the pace in recent weeks — a critical point that could in the long term decide whether Tesla lives or dies. [Musk casts himself as a superhero. But he sweats the details on factory floor.] Tesla allowed Washington Post journalists last week to tour the factory, drive a Model 3 and partake in a few laps around its high-speed test track, where the cars are checked for noise, build precision and quality. Officials said Musk was visiting Tesla’s Gigafactory battery plant in Nevada after several weeks at the Fremont factory and did not make him available for an interview, though they pointed to a small alcove at the center of the factory where they said he often retreats at night to sleep. The 5 million-square-foot car plant in the industrial barrens outside Silicon Valley has become one of the world’s most widely watched factories, in part because of Musk’s promise that he would transform it into a hyper-automated “alien dreadnought” that he called the “machine that builds the machine.” Tesla’s push to automate every finicky detail led to major delays — “Humans are underrated,” Musk later admitted — and workers are now stationed on nearly every part of the production line. To reach its Model 3 production goal, Tesla resorted to relatively primitive measures, moving some production to a makeshift tent in the parking lot. (Officials did not allow reporters to view the tent.)    A Tesla employee works on Model X dashboard components at the Fremont factory. (Mason Trinca for The Washington Post)  Even after that automating experiment backfired, the factory remains crowded with the red arms of high-powered German robots — 1,028 of which work on the Model 3 body line alone. Unlike in traditional auto plants, nearly a third of the robots hang from the ceiling, a space-saving move that has the effect of turning corners of the factory into caverns. This “robot symphony,” as one official calls it, turns giant rolls of aluminum into Model 3 skeletons, which dangle above the factory floor as they are welded, bolted and assembled with motors, seats and batteries. Along the way, scanner robots inspect components’ precision down to the millimeter, craning a camera around every angle like the head of a curious bird. [Former Tesla employee blasted by Musk files whistleblower complaint] For years, Musk promised the Model 3 would offer definitive proof that his luxury automaker could make cars for everyone, including a $35,000 mass-market sedan that would help wean the world off oil and look good doing it. But the cheapest models available now start at about $50,000 — selling the car now for its minimum price would, Musk tweeted, “cause Tesla to lose money & die” — meaning Tesla has remained what it has always been: a company that makes stylish cars for well-off people. The big question for Tesla now is where it will find the money it needs to stay afloat. In the past, the company could raise as much money as it wanted, earning a market value higher than General Motors even as it claimed a fraction of the sales. But analysts say investors are starting to value Tesla not as an insurgent tech visionary but as a car company with three expensive products, a volatile factory and a limited fan base. Musk says the company will not need to raise more money, and he has laughed off the idea of financial doomsday, tweeting a fake press release on April Fools’ Day that said Tesla had gone “so bankrupt you can’t believe it.” But in recent months the company has laid off 9\\xa0percent of its workforce and has lost dozens of high-ranking sales, service and engineering executives.    Tesla employees get assembly training last week. (Mason Trinca for The Washington Post)  Tesla also recently took the unconventional step of asking some suppliers to refund money it had already paid them for parts, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The company defended the request as a standard negotiation tool used to boost cash flow and “improve our competitive advantage.” [Battle between Musk and ex-Tesla employee turns ugly, exposing internal rancor] As Tesla’s turmoil has grown, so, too, have the fights among its fans and detractors, whose unique polarization is more akin to political parties than companies. Musk has not hesitated to punch back at investors, journalists and anyone else who criticizes him. An anonymous blogger critical of Tesla, known as “Montana Skeptic,” said last week that Musk had called his employer to complain, sparking outrage over what some said was Musk’s campaign to silence his critics. Tesla said that the man’s employer is a “longtime Tesla supporter” and that when the company “became aware” of the blogger’s actions, he “volunteered to stop.” In a set of since-deleted 4 a.m. tweets, Musk seemed to take a victory lap, posting a photo of singer Miley Cyrus (the former “Hannah Montana”) and suggesting the blogger’s pseudonym was “a girls name.” Trapped in the center of these battles have been Tesla’s thousands of rank-and-file employees, who have been pushed to fulfill ever-climbing demands during what Musk has called “production hell.” Musk, a famous workaholic, said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in June that some employees had “worked 60 days straight.” Tesla has for years exerted a magnetic pull on Silicon Valley’s ambitious workforce, and employees at the factory said they felt the company gave them a freedom to try new things that other process-driven automakers might not. But some workers during the factory tour acknowledged that, even for high-achievers, “Tesla has a way of wearing people out,” as one employee put it. Asked about his work hours, one engineer who helped design the Model 3’s chassis instead gave his nonworking time — 7 to 9 p.m. — adding, “I’ve been 24/7 since the day I started.” The company required, as a condition of the tour, that The Post not identify workers by name. Another engineer working on automotive noise and vibration said he had quit in 2015 because of a mix of “ridiculous hours,” the birth of his child and a “very bad conversation with Elon” but returned after a year because he said the job made him feel “empowered” to fix big problems and change the world. (Tesla later characterized his conversation with Musk not as bad but “intense.”) He tells his team now that “everybody should have more work than they can do, all the time, because that’s how Tesla works,” though he adds that it is their job to find a way to manage those ever-growing demands. “If you don’t reach that point, this place will steamroll you,” he said. Cruising off the test track after a reporter ride-along, the engineer laughed and said hey to a passing driver — one of his employees who, having suffered his own massive burnout, had just returned from a six-month break. He smiled as he steered a Model 3 onto the test track, and within a few seconds he disappeared.    Tesla Model 3s in the inventory lot at the Fremont factory.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would cost the federal government $33\\xa0trillion by 2031, arguing that it proves Democrats have moved too far left. Sanders, looking at the same study, says it shows his “Medicare for All” proposal would save Americans $2 trillion. What’s going on here? Republicans such as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) are correct that enacting Sanders’s single-payer plan would add trillions to government books, by placing all Americans on one government health insurer, according to both the study’s author and Sanders himself. But Sanders is right that the study concludes that his plan would reduce overall spending on health care in the United States. Most U.S. spending on health care is done through the private sector. Sanders’s plan would transition virtually all of that spending to the public sector, dramatically increasing government expenditures on health care while also reducing national health-care spending overall, according to the report. Sanders’s plan would also give health insurance to about 30 million Americans who lack it, while eliminating deductibles and premiums charged through private insurance. “A Medicare-for-All health-care system would save the average family significant sums of money,” Sanders said in an email to The Washington Post. “Yes, an individual may pay more in taxes, but that family of four that is spending $28,000 a year for health care today will no longer pay premiums, co-pays or deductibles to private insurance companies.” From 2019 to 2028, the federal government would spend an average of 2.8 trillion more per year on health care if Sanders’s plan were fully in place, according to the study, published by the Mercatus Center, a libertarian-leaning think tank. The study — written by Charles Blahous, a former official in President George W. Bush’s administration — notes that this price tag would not be covered by doubling what the government currently takes in through individual and corporate taxes. Sanders’s plan calls for transitioning everyone in the United States onto the government health plan over the course of four years. In the first year, the federal government would drop the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 55 — a proposal also backed by many centrist Senate Democrats — as well as enrolling everyone currently on Medicare and everyone younger than 18. It would then slowly add the rest of the population over the next three years, while offering insurance that charges no premiums or deductibles. These changes would lead the U.S. government to control virtually all health spending in the United States — Sanders’s plan would also cover dental care and vision care — in what may be the biggest increase in federal expenditures in history, according to Blahous. “The primary effect here is the expansion of the federal government,” Blahous said. His report questions whether it would be “desirable or practicable” for the federal government to so dramatically increase its spending on health care, given that the increase would dwarf many of the government’s other spending priorities. But to single-payer advocates, there is no obvious difference to the average American between sending their money to a private insurer through premiums and sending it to the government through higher taxes. And, they say, putting all Americans on one insurer would create a large-enough pool to force private health-care providers to charge less, while eliminating private insurers’ spending on marketing and administrative overhead that do not improve health outcomes. On its current trajectory, the United States is projected to spend $7.65 trillion annually on health care by 2031, according to the Mercatus study. That number would drop to $7.35 trillion if Sanders’s plan were implemented, the study found. Over time, that adds up to a net savings of about $2.1 trillion. “It’s a surprisingly positive view of Medicare for All from a very conservative research institute,” Larry Levitt, a health-care expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said of the Mercatus report. “According to the analysis, you could provide universal coverage with no patient cost-sharing and actually spend less on health care than we would under the status quo.” Asked about the projected drop in national health spending, Blahous said the rise in government health-care spending was the significant finding of his report, not the change in overall national health spending. He also said that long-term pricing projections are inherently volatile and that he made generous assumptions about Sanders’s cost savings, also noting that in some other scenarios he analyzed, net health spending would go up. “I’ve made all the favorable assumptions with respect to the author’s intent,” Blahous said in an interview. “The striking number people have to grapple with is whether the federal government could take on something of this magnitude.” But Adam Gaffney, an expert at the Harvard Medical School who supports single payer, said Blahous is underestimating by billions of dollars the savings Sanders’s plan would create, by reducing spending on prescription drugs and administrative overhead. Whether the U.S. political system could stomach the scale of these changes is another question altogether. Single-payer systems in many European countries demonstrate that they can reduce overall national health spending, but that does not mean that a Democratic administration could implement one without incurring an immense political backlash, said Harold Pollack, a health-care expert at the University of Chicago. “I don’t look at this report and say it is a partisan hack job: The basic idea the Sanders plan would require a substantial increase in federal budget outlays is correct,” Pollack said. “But over the long run, the Sanders people are very correct that you could implement a system like this that would be more disciplined, more economical and more fair than the current U.S. health system.” Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the study’s estimate of increased government spending from 2019 to 2028 if Sanders’s plan were fully in place. It would be an annual average increase of $2.8 trillion, not $2.5 trillion.

The ruling African National Congress has vowed to step up wealth distribution and promised “radical economic transformation,” including constitutional changes to allow the government to expropriate land without paying for it. 1. Why is land ownership an issue? Under the rule of European colonists, South Africa’s Natives Land Act of 1913 stripped most black people of their right to own property, a policy reinforced decades later by the National Party and its system of apartheid, or apartness. A government land audit released in February showed that farms and agricultural holdings comprise 97 percent of the 121.9 million hectares of the nation’s area, and that whites own 72 percent of the 37 million hectares held by individuals. This tallies with the results of a separate audit released Nov. 1 by Agri Development Solutions and farm lobby group AGRI SA, which found non-whites own 27 percent of the nation’s farmland compared with 14 percent in 1994. 2. What’s been done until now? Since 1994, when the ANC became the nation’s dominant post-apartheid party, the state has bought 4.9 million hectares\\xa0-- about 4 percent of the country’s total territory -- for land redistribution, with about 3.4 million hectares assigned to new owners, according to former Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti.\\xa0Those who didn’t want the land allocated to them opted for money instead, with 11.6 billion rand ($873 million) paid out from 1994 until January 2017. A separate initiative known as the 50-50 program, meant to encourage joint black-white land management, uses government funds to buy half a farmer’s land and give it to laborers working there.\\xa0It started in 2016. 3. What changes are on the table? Parliament had proposed legislation that would allow the government to pay “just and equitable” compensation -- meaning, less than market prices -- for land it expropriates. Former President Jacob Zuma sent the bill back to lawmakers, saying it wouldn’t pass constitutional muster. Another bill, offered for public comment in March 2017 by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, would ban foreigners from buying agricultural land and require them instead to enter into long-term leases. It also calls for creating a commission that will set up a register of land ownership that will include race and the size of the holding. On Dec. 20, the ANC, under newly elected party president Cyril Ramaphosa, said expropriating land without compensation should be among mechanisms to effect land reform, as long as it doesn’t undermine the economy, agricultural production and food security. On July 31, the ANC said it would push for a proposed amendment to the constitution to make it clearer under which conditions land can be expropriated without compensation. That’s a shift from May, when it said the government should test the nation’s current laws because they may not need to change to allow for taking land without pay. 4. What is the party’s plan? On Feb. 27, lawmakers agreed to the principle of land expropriation without compensation, and parliament’s Constitutional Review Committee will report back to lawmakers on changes to section 25 of the Constitution by the enc of August, following nationwide public hearings. The opposition Economic Freedom Fighters party proposed a motion to allow land seizures to the legislature, while the ANC proposed amendments. Zuma has also called for a precolonial audit of land ownership, use and occupation patterns. 5. Is taking land without compensation legal? Not at the moment. AGRI SA, the biggest organization representing the country’s farmers, says the constitution doesn’t provide for expropriation without “just and equitable” compensation. Deprivation of property without compensation “constitutes a very serious breach of an individual’s rights,” it said. 6. Why is the ANC doing this now? The party was initially reticent to allow expropriation without paying. Under Zuma, it came under pressure as economic growth stagnated, and there were calls for his resignation from the opposition, civic leaders and senior officials in his own party, following a series of scandals and an unpopular cabinet reshuffle. He left as the nation’s president in February and was replaced by Ramaphosa. The ANC lost voters in 2016 local elections to parties including the EFF, and Zuma’s reputation eroded the party’s standing to such an extent that it was at risk of losing its majority in 2019 elections. The party needs policies that will gain traction among the nation’s poor, who make up the majority of the electorate. 7. What’s the outlook in parliament? Two-thirds of lawmakers would have to assent to change the constitution. The ANC holds 62 percent of the seats. The EFF,\\xa0South Africa’s third-biggest political party, has 6.4 percent. • ANC statement on adopting expropriation without compensation • How Zuma and his deputy differ on “radical economic transformation.” • A possible wealth tax is also being considered as a way to improve the standard of living of black South Africans. • AGRI SA’s take on the constitutionality of expropriation without compensation. • The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform’s 2017 land audit, released in February 2018, and its 2013 land audit. • The University of the Western Cape’s Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies overview of the distribution of land.

The agency is studying whether to allow investment income, known as capital gains, to be adjusted for inflation in a way that shields more of it from taxation. Most capital gains are paid by wealthier Americans, who disproportionately hold large portfolios of investments. But the use of executive power on such a significant change to the tax law would be highly unusual and could be vulnerable to a legal challenge. Senior administration officials have discussed whether to proceed but have not concluded they have legal authority to do so. The move was rejected during the George H.W. Bush administration because it was seen as outside the scope of Treasury’s authority and only attainable via an act of Congress. The idea has long been advocated by White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, but tax changes this drastic are typically made by Congress, not the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service. Still, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the New York Times in an interview that he was reviewing whether to move ahead if Congress doesn’t act on its own. “If it can’t get done through a legislation process, we will look at what tools at Treasury we have to do it on our own and we’ll consider that,” Mnuchin told the New York Times. “We are studying that internally, and we are also studying the economic costs and the impact on growth.” Mnuchin made clear that he had not decided whether he would approve such a change. And he has not determined whether he believes the change would be legal, two senior administration officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.    Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin gestures during a news conference on July 22. (EITAN ABRAMOVICH/AFP/Getty Images)  Republicans passed a massive package of tax cuts last year that lowered the tax rate for all income groups, with big benefits going to wealthy Americans and businesses. Despite mounting worries from lawmakers about the growing federal deficit, Trump said earlier this year that Congress was going to try to pass another package of tax cuts this year that would be largely targeted at helping the middle class. Senate Republicans have not signaled how they plan to proceed. “Once again, Republicans have exposed the true priorities of their tax scam: billions in tax breaks for the wealthiest at the expense of everyone else,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement. “American families are drowning under the weight of stagnant wages, higher health costs and soaring prescription drug costs, but the GOP continues to pick their pockets to give more handouts to the wealthiest 1\\xa0percent.” Capital gains represents the income someone receives from an investment over time. If an investor buys a stock for $100,000 and sells it later for $110,000, they have a capital gain of $10,000 and typically must pay a tax on that difference. The $100,000 initial purchase price is considered the “cost” of the investment, and the capital gain is determined based on the cost. Kudlow and others have said the cost should be indexed to inflation. So once an investor sells an investment, if that “cost basis” is considered higher because of inflation, the capital gain would be less, requiring an investor to pay less in taxes. But any unilateral change could be subject to a court challenge from other groups that want their own tax-related concerns indexed to inflation. And other groups could sue and say it is outside the scope of Treasury’s authority to make a legal ruling that needs congressional authorization. In September 1992, the Justice Department during the end of the Bush administration found that Treasury did not have the legal authority to make the change unilaterally. It predicted that adopting the inflation change without input from Congress would be challenged in court, and that the government would lose the case. Conservatives have long sought to cut capital gains taxes, arguing that it would encourage investors to sell stock and move their money toward new investments, helping more companies grow. But these proposals have often faltered in Congress because of how the changes would disproportionately aid the wealthiest households. Researchers have estimated that the top 5 percent of households in terms of income hold about two-thirds of all stock and mutual fund investments, putting wealthier Americans in the position of benefiting much more than others from any changes to capital gains rules. Several congressional Republicans have introduced plans that would legislatively index capital gains to inflation, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Devin Nunes of California. The idea has also been promoted widely by Grover Norquist, founder of Americans for Tax Reform and a leading conservative voice on tax cuts. Steve Moore, a close friend of Kudlow’s, said there is an active debate within the Treasury Department over whether to try to unilaterally make the changes to capital gains. Some political appointees support the idea, while career staffers are more cautious, knowing it has been rejected before. “The thing is, Trump is so gutsy, he’s doing so many of these things administratively, and he’s the kind of person I could see who would instruct the Treasury to do it,” Moore said. “That would be gigantic with the economy. .\\u2009.\\u2009. There’s a big robust debate going on within the Treasury Department about whether or not to do this. It’s definitely in the mix.” Mark Mazur, a longtime IRS official who served in a senior role in the Obama administration’s Treasury Department, said the policy change was studied many years ago and was deemed to be outside the bounds of executive authority. Changes of this magnitude are supposed to be written by lawmakers, Mazur said, not decided by administration officials. It’s unclear whether Treasury could make the decision without any additional input or whether the Justice Department would have to write a legal opinion redefining cost basis. Mazur is the director of the Tax Policy Center, which studies fiscal proposals. It recently published an analysis of what indexing capital gains to inflation might mean, and it found that the tax savings could be substantial. Leonard Burman, an institute fellow at the center, found that such a change, depending on how it was designed, could cut taxes by up to $20\\xa0billion for the wealthiest Americans and make it easier for sophisticated investors to create tax shelters.

(Patrick Semansky/AP)   by Sam Fortier August 1 at 12:07 PM Email the author   OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Robert Griffin III stepped to the microphone and grinned at the reporters as if he’d missed this. It was late morning at Under Armour Performance Center and the Baltimore Ravens, his third team in four years, had just finished practice. As Griffin started to respond to a reporter who greeted him, he realized how close the mic was to his mouth. “This is awkward,” he said, flashing his familiar, gaptoothed smile. The grin had rarely been seen since Griffin, the No. 2 overall draft pick of the Redskins in 2012, carried Washington to its first playoff appearance in five seasons as a rookie. That year, Griffin’s jersey sold more than any other in the league, and a brand was born: “RG3.” Just a few years later, Griffin had all but vanished from the realm of NFL relevancy. Injuries and a building tension between Griffin and Washington set up an ugly end, and after an injury-shortened season in Cleveland, he was out of the league. At the mic, Griffin tried to distance himself from what happened down I-95 while facing questions about how he would dig himself out of the rubble of once-great expectations. Ravens Coach John Harbaugh told reporters Griffin’s absence from the game for a year didn’t worry him, that it “wasn’t a very hard” call to sign him and General Manager Ozzie Newsome had decided “pretty quickly.” Griffin, 28, answered with a similar earnestness. He compared being away from football to “someone taking your girl, it gives you an appreciation,” joked about staying in shape by throwing footballs at palm trees, and asserted he was faster than rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson, another speedy Heisman winner who was drafted No. 32 overall in April as the heir apparent to starting quarterback Joe Flacco. In discussing that year away, Griffin never mentioned how much he prepared for life after football — or how the 2020 Olympic Games had come to mind. Griffin, who won the Heisman Trophy while at Baylor, understands it will take more than his natural talent for him to make the team. The Ravens have not carried three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster since 2009. He will have his first chance to show everyone what can still do on Thursday, as Baltimore faces Chicago in the Hall of Fame Game at 8 p.m. “Everyone laughs about the sayings I had when I first came into the league, but ‘No pressure, no diamonds’ is one that stuck with me,” Griffin said in an interview following his news conference. “That’s what we said in college. I’ve been under a lot of pressure in my life. I’ve been under a lot of pressure in my NFL career. I’m ready to shine. I think God’s prepared me for it.”    Griffin is likely third on the team’s QB depth chart behind starter Joe Flacco (right) and rookie first-round pick Lamar Jackson (not pictured). (Patrick Semansky/AP)  To listen to Griffin tell it, leaving football “never crossed my mind.” Those around him got a different impression. In the summer of 2017, he was living in Orlando with his second wife, Estonian heptathlete Grete Sadeiko. He received contract offers from Arizona and Baltimore, but neither situation seemed right because of personnel or timing, so he turned them down. Still, though, he trained. “Anyone going through something hard has doubts,” Griffin said, quickly clarifying that he never doubted himself throughout this process. He meant those around him. “My wife would say, ‘Why are you doing this? Why are you running these hills? Why are you throwing these footballs, studying this film? You’re not getting that call. Why keep doing that?’” Last winter, Griffin cold-called a training facility he’d heard of near home and, within a week, he walked into the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. The facility appealed to Griffin because it had football and a track-and-field program, helmed by coach Brooks Johnson, who also trained Sadeiko. At Baylor, Griffin ran the 400-meter hurdles all the way to the 2008 Olympic Trials semifinals but left track — even though “at heart, I’m a track guy” — to focus on football. He started to consider a comeback. Griffin split time between the football and track workouts, where he trained alongside Olympians, including Justin Gatlin, who last year outran Usain Bolt for the gold in the 100-meter dash at the world championships. Griffin, who once weighed more than 225 pounds, had slimmed down to 193. He spoke with Johnson about preparing for the decathlon or the 110-meter hurdles. “He didn’t look at himself as RGIII,” Gatlin said. “He looked at himself as Robert. He was hungry, and he had another a shot to get back out there.”     Robert Griffin III took the NFL by storm during his rookie season with the Redskins in 2012. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)     American sprinter Justin Gatlin said that within a year, Griffin would have been seriously contending for a spot in the Olympics. (Jae C. Hong/AP)    For about 10 weeks, Griffin arrived at the facility four days per week at 8:30 a.m. and, over the next five hours, stretched, lifted weights, honed footwork and threw to receivers. Whenever workouts called for speed, he sidled over to Johnson. When asked if track was a plan B, Griffin said he didn’t think so, citing one of his favorite quotes from actor Will Smith: “There’s no reason to have a plan B because it distracts from plan A.” But the track group watched Griffin chip away at his rusty technique. At first, his body launched wide and splayed over the hurdles, but it quickly became tighter. Griffin is 6-foot-2, but Gatlin said football’s emphasis on low centers of gravity conditioned Griffin to run as if he were 5-foot-2. His short strides generated less power. Slowly, Griffin ran straighter, lengthening his legs. The knee injury that hampered his football career seemed to have no effect. Within a year, Gatlin and Johnson said, Griffin would have seriously contended for a spot at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. “He is an Olympic-level talent,” Johnson said. “It didn’t take a lot to get him technically sound.” Then Baltimore called. It was late March, at the beginning of free agency, and Griffin considered it “a message from God” and that “things don’t just happen by accident.” He inked a one-year, $1.1 million deal. In the facility, during stretches and cool-downs, Griffin started bringing index cards made from the Ravens playbook. While they worked out together, Sadeiko quizzed him on the team’s formations and he listed off the personnel. Some people around Griffin attribute his shelving of track, again, to the money at stake in the NFL. For others, it’s deeper. Griffin’s life has seemingly been governed by the same purpose since his uncle signed him up for youth football two decades ago. He was recently told by two global track powers that he’s still got it, and he still returned to the sport where he’s torn his right anterior cruciate ligament twice, dislocated his left ankle once, snapped a bone in his left shoulder and sustained at least two documented concussions. He spent one season as a third-string quarterback, appearing at safety on the practice squad, and another completely away from the game and still, each time, he found it harder to stay away than come back. He does not feel a biological imperative to play football. He feels a religious one. “I know what God’s called me to do,” Griffin said. “He’s called me to play football at a high level, inspire men, lead men. That’s why I didn’t have any doubt in what I was doing.” During a training session in the practice complex earlier this year, football coach Bert Whigham walked by Griffin, who was talking to a player preparing for the NFL Draft. “One day football will be done with you,” Whigham heard Griffin tell the prospect, “but you’ll never be done with football.”    “I know what God’s called me to do,” Griffin said. “He’s called me to play football at a high level, inspire men, lead men. That’s why I didn’t have any doubt in what I was doing.” (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)  On the third day of training camp, Griffin ran off the field, swigged from a water bottle and sank down on his right knee next to his wife on Practice Field 1. After the final whistle blew, Griffin had spent about 20 minutes sprinting and throwing corner routes to the end zone, as he always does. Griffin spoke for about 15 minutes with his wife, whose back rested against the goal post. The fields were otherwise empty. A couple of Ravens staffers and a group of fans stared at Griffin and his wife, then whispered to one another. A handful of fans then walked by Griffin, and Griffin obliged the oldest man’s request for a picture and autograph. A few moments later, Flacco walked out of a team-facility door. “Oh my God, oh my God!” one of the boys yelled at his seven friends. “Guys, look who it is!” The boys, and everyone else, rushed to Flacco’s side. They clamored for him to stand next to them for the camera and sign their helmets, balls and jerseys. Hearing the commotion, Griffin turned and saw the mob around Flacco. He stared at the starting quarterback, playing the part that once seemed destined to be his, and his face remained blank.    When the Ravens called, Griffin considered it “a message from God.” (Patrick Semansky/AP)  ', 'RGIII had a shot at the Olympics.

He peered through black-rimmed glasses and gripped a microphone as he spoke. It looked like a pencil in his big, basketball hands.  “In closing, thank you so much,” James said. “We love you!” the crowd shouted. “I love you, too,” he replied. “I really do. I really do.” And when the cheers softened, The Kid From Akron ended a day in which he strengthened his commitment to his hometown by doing something seemingly contradictory. He said goodbye. “And know, no matter if I’m playing in Los Angeles or not, Akron, Ohio, is always home for me,” James said. “Always.” James called Monday perhaps the greatest day of his life. He celebrated the opening of the I Promise School, the offspring of an enterprising partnership between his foundation and Akron Public Schools that intends to change the lives of some of the city’s most underprivileged children. But this was also his first public appearance since he left the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Los Angeles Lakers in early July. And so if this was the greatest day of his life, he also admitted it was bittersweet. “On one hand, I’m opening up a school where I would love to be here every single day when my schedule permits,” James said late Monday afternoon, standing in a classroom in the stunning facility. “And then on the other hand, I’m starting a new journey in my life where I’m on the other coast. But when you have the support system and you have the people around you that’s helped you along the way, you know you never travel alone. So it makes the transition easier.” [As LeBron James heads west, can the once-great Lakers rise to his level?] James is moving away. And he is staying forever. In his world, this is neither contradictory nor unorthodox. He doesn’t feel the need to choose. He can be King James and The Kid from Akron. He can live in just one place, but his impact can be ubiquitous. He can satisfy his worldly curiosity while keeping his promise to uplift his home region. As James’s two passions clashed on this day, it was also clear what allows them to operate jointly: ambition. Whatever the persona or pursuit, it is ambition that makes James the quintessential American sports superstar. In everything he does, he refuses to settle, and he dreams a little differently. So it figures he would be the fish that wants to swim in the small and big pond simultaneously. On Monday, he made history at home and fantasized about adding to the tradition of the Lakers, one of the NBA’s historic superpowers. “There’s no reason you should become a Laker, become a Yankee, become part of Man U, become part of some franchise or clubs like that, and you don’t think about winning championships or winning at the highest level,” James said. “That’s what the history is all about.” But for the most part, James kept his reasoning for signing with the Lakers understated. He talked a little about it to appease the media, which he thanked for coming to Akron to cover the school opening. But he was adamant about focusing on the I Promise School. When James returned to the Cavaliers four years ago, he was intent on fulfilling a promise. He wanted to deliver a championship, which he did in the most dramatic manner possible in 2016, upsetting the 73-win Golden State Warriors after falling behind 3-1 in the NBA Finals. But he also wanted to make more of a difference at home. A few years ago, James was brainstorming with Michele Campbell, the executive director of the LeBron James Family Foundation. They were talking about making an even greater impact. In 2011, the foundation established its I Promise program, taking on a class of third graders and giving them the resources, incentives and support — academically and emotionally — to thrive. Campbell’s idea for a school was the extension of that concept. She thought she was just thinking out loud — couldn’t we help more kids and families with an entire school? — but James reacted seriously. “Well, why aren’t you doing that then?” James said, according to Campbell. The I Promise School has begun with 240 students, 120 each in the third and fourth grades. The plan is to expand gradually and serve students from kindergarten to eighth grade by 2022. The students being served have dire academic and emotional needs. They are some of the lowest-performing students in the district. The mission is to turn around the children’s academic lives by changing the lives of everyone in their families. The school provides services to assist children dealing with trauma and to support and educate parents trying to survive poverty. At the school, there are opportunities for parents who didn’t graduate high school to study for their GEDs. There is a pantry with donations from a food bank, and parents can pick up groceries to take home and prepare meals. They call this approach “family wraparound support.” “I think the missing link in public education is that family wraparound support,” Principal Brandi Davis said. “Because our students come to school, and they’re worried about things at home. It could be a wealth of issues going on at home. Just to know when I drop my child off at school I can go down the hallway to the family resource center and get the support I need, that just takes so much off of a parent, so much off of a child. And that’s what that trauma-informed support is all about. We want to create that safe, that secure and that caring and loving environment for our families and our students so that our kids can focus on education. And that’s what we’re all about.” This is James’s vision, right down to having 240 bicycles available so that every student has a free bike to ride. As a child, James found freedom on his bike. It helped him flee his dangerous neighborhood and venture to the parts of the city where he could play basketball, engage in productive activities and allow the community to help him. The thoughtfulness of James and his mother, Gloria, is evident in the school. They were able to turn their past pain into a crystallized understanding of what impoverished families need. James can recall missing 83 days of school as a fourth grader and being in danger of becoming “a statistic” before members of the community helped him. “School didn’t mean anything, obviously, back then,” James said of himself. “It was a surprise to me when I woke up and I was actually going to school. A lot of empty days, a lot of empty nights.” Look at him now. He’s a superstar of superstars. He knows he’s special, but he also thinks he’s lucky. He encountered people who cared, and they put him on the right path. Then basketball took his life to another level. “That’s what kids want to know, ‘Do you care about me?’\\u2009” James said. “And we do here.” The goal for the I Promise School is the same as the rest of James’s goals: Be great. The challenge is tremendous, but with one tour of the school, you can see clearly that the investment is serious. From the moment you walk in and see 114 of James’s game-worn shoes hanging from the walls in decorative fashion, you think about what dreamers can do with proper support. “Limitation is not in my vocabulary,” Davis said. “There’s always a way to get around. Working with the LeBron James Family Foundation, they have truly removed all barriers in more ways than one.” As James departs for Los Angeles, perhaps for good, he leaves behind a legacy that will outlast him. Monday was incredible — and bittersweet. But if this school lives up to its promise, time will erase any conflicted feelings. King James is moving away. The spirit of The Kid from Akron is staying forever.

(Dylan Buell/Getty Images)   by Chelsea Janes July 31 at 7:47 PM Email the author   Trea Turner had tears in his eyes when he sat down in front of reporters Tuesday afternoon. He took a deep breath before he spoke, visibly shaken, as if a great weight had settled onto his shoulders in the day since racially insensitive and homophobic tweets from his college years resurfaced Sunday. No standard unit exists for measuring sincerity, but Turner, who\\xa0has never been one to show emotion, looked every bit like a man experiencing the reality of his guilt, not searching for a way to explain it away. “For starters, I want to apologize everybody that was affected by things that I said: LBGT community, African American community, special needs community,” Turner said, speaking without notes or a prepared speech in front of him, eyes welled. “I’m truly sorry for what I said and I want to take full responsibility for that. I want to apologize to my teammates, I just talked to them, make sure that they know my thoughts and where I’m at. I want to apologize to Mike Rizzo and the Nationals for bringing this distraction to their team, their organization, sorry for that as well. Most importantly, apologize to the fans. A lot of fans had been sharing their thoughts in the last few days and I’ve had a chance to read a few of them. I think that’s where it is most affected by what I said and I want to apologize to those people.” [Svrluga: When an athlete’s ugly tweets hit home, ‘it feels like an actual gut-punch’] Turner did not make excuses for the comments. He pointed out that being a teenager does not remove responsibility, that no matter how old he was, he should have known better than to use homophobic slurs or derogatory terms for members of the special needs community . “It’s not when I said the things I said,” Turner said. “It’s that I said them at all.” Nationals management and players did not give excuses for Turner, either. All vouched for the man they see every day. “It can’t be glossed over,” Rizzo said. “Those things are very, very serious,” Rizzo said. “… The Trea Turner I know since we brought him into the organization is a fine human being. He’s a fine person and a guy who conducts himself in a very dignified, classy manner.” “There’s really no room for that kind of talk or language in the game of baseball, or really America and in the world,” Adam Eaton said. “… That being said, the year and a half I’ve known Trea, he’s been an outstanding person in all walks of life — doesn’t matter if you’re gay or straight, black, purple, orange. He’s been an outstanding person to all of us.” Dave Martinez choked up when asked about his shortstop, who has stopped by to check on the rookie manager at tough points in the season and has emerged as a respected presence in the clubhouse during his short career. Martinez condemned the tweets, said the organization doesn’t condone those things. Then, when asked how he knew Turner was sincere in his apologies, Martinez teared up and pushed through a few cracks of his normally steady voice. “[Trea] started crying,” Martinez said. “That tells me he’s sincere.” Turner’s demeanor suggested sincerity, whatever such cues are worth in situations like these. He did not try to dodge responsibility. He acknowledged how moved he was by fan stories. As for whether his views have changed? “I don’t think that I’ve ever had those views that people are saying about me,” Turner said. “[But it’s] fair. I think you can definitely accuse me of that.” Sean Doolittle, who posted a lengthy Twitter thread about the need for players to be more careful about what they post on social media and what happens when they do not, said he does not think Turner’s tweets “reflect who he is now.” Doolittle has been an outspoken advocate for the LGBT community, as well as the need for acceptance more broadly. [Sean Doolittle: ‘There’s no place for racism, insensitive language or even casual homophobia’] “I think sometimes when you’re that age, you might know those things are wrong to say but maybe you don’t know anybody that’s been personally affected by them. It’s tough for you to really understand the damage, the real damage that they can and do cause,” Doolittle said. “… He has the opportunity to demonstrate that growth and we have to give that space for him to be able to demonstrate that he’s grown and he’s changed since then.” Turner said he is trying to determine the best way to demonstrate that growth, to use his platform for good instead of the hurt he caused with those tweets. “I think going forward I can do a lot more things, I just need to assess what’s important to me, what can make the biggest difference,” Turner said. “From reading the last few days, being a kid and things kids go through is kind of overlooked. That’s something I would like to take part in. I have in the past couple years done quite a bit through the team, but doing more and more is better.” Turner already participates in MLB’s Shred Hate initiative, an anti-bullying program for which he has spoken to children and filmed public service ads. He said he does not feel that is enough, nor did he point to that as a way to get himself off the hook. He did not point to anything like that, nor hunt for a way out of what happened. Even after his news conference, Turner sat quietly at his locker, where anyone who wanted to could press him further. As he headed out for batting practice, he passed a young Nationals fan with a sign that read “Go Trea Turner.” He knows not everyone shares the notion now. “A lot of times people says kids, kids, kids. Kids look up to you the most,” Turner said. “But there’s plenty of adults that have reached out to me that gave their side of the story. It’s not just one person, one community, it’s a lot of people in a lot different places doing a lot of different things. I think that’s something that athletes have to keep in mind. It’s not a niche, or a small community, or one person, it’s much larger.” Read more baseball coverage: Bryce Harper on Nationals considering trades: ‘Glad I’m still inside this clubhouse’ MLB trade deadline delivers fireworks, as five former all-stars dealt in the final two hours Red Sox get second baseman Ian Kinsler as Tuesday’s 4 p.m. trade deadline draws near In Roberto Osuna, the Astros acquire an all-star closer — and an ongoing domestic violence case Braves’ Sean Newcomb addresses ugly old tweets right after just missing a no-hitter ', 'Trea Turner, in a tearful news conference, takes ‘full responsibility’ for his past tweets - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/07/31/we-want-johnny-manziel-chants-get-under-the-skin-of-montreal-alouettes-quarterback/': ('Johnny Manziel is ready for his Canadian close-up. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press via AP)   by Matt Bonesteel August 1 at 6:51 AM Email the author   Johnny Manziel will take a major step in his attempt at career revitalization Friday night, when he will start for the Montreal Alouettes at home against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. It will be his first appearance in a professional football game since December 2015, when he took his final snaps for the Cleveland Browns before the NFL franchise cut him months later after numerous off-field incidents.   🚨Confirmed!🚨Johnny Manziel will be the starting quarterback this Friday, August 3 against the @Ticats. #AlsMTL #ToujoursGame #JohnnyFootball #Number2 pic.twitter.com/Soy42t6IGx— #AlsMTL (@MTLAlouettes) July 31, 2018    “It’s good to be back in here,” Manziel told reporters Tuesday. “I felt like the thing I’ve been missing, even over the course of this year and a couple years, is reps. And as you guys have seen the last couple days, a chance to get with the 1s and get some reps is what I feel like I really need and what I’ve talked to a lot of people about. “So I feel very blessed to be in this position, to be back in a situation where I’m starting again. It’s good. It’s a quick turnaround. But at the same time, I’m excited for the opportunity.” The Alouettes acquired Manziel from the Tiger-Cats in a trade on July 22. Hamilton had signed the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner to a two-year contract in May but traded him after incumbent quarterback Jeremiah Masoli got off to a strong start to the CFL season. It quickly became apparent that Montreal Coach Mike Sherman intended to get Manziel onto the field as quickly as possible, with his team struggling to a 1-5 start. “We didn’t trade for Johnny to have him sit on the bench. Obviously he’s come here to get reps; to become the best player he can become. We started that process today,” Sherman said Monday, per the Montreal Gazette, about whether Manziel would replace incumbent starter Vernon Adams Jr. “You’ve all probably figured it out yourselves. At the same time, when you have two players [fairly equal], you probably wait until game time to make that announcement. It doesn’t make sense to do it any sooner.” Montreal has burned through four quarterbacks already this season, with\\xa0Drew Willy, Matt Shiltz and Jeff Mathews all getting injured — the Alouettes’ offensive line has allowed 23 sacks through six games — and Adams mostly ineffective in\\xa0Thursday night’s 44-23 home loss to the Edmonton Eskimos. During the game, fans chanted\\xa0“Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!” and “We want Johnny!” Some of them already had purchased Manziel jerseys. On Monday, the day Manziel began taking first-team snaps in practice, Adams expressed his extreme displeasure with that reaction. “Yes, it hurt me to hear that. I have nothing more to say or to give to the supporters of Montreal. Never again,” Adams\\xa0told La Presse, per TSN’s translation.\\xa0“Their behavior was very disrespectful. It was not like I was playing badly. I do not want them to ask me for anything, not even a small piece of equipment.” “I do not care what the situation is. It was a lack of respect and it affected me,” Adams continued.\\xa0“I tried anyways to make plays on the field. But that’s fine. In the future, I’ll treat the fans as they treated me. That’s all.” Adams’s frustration may stem from the fact that Manziel is about to cost him his second CFL job. The Tiger-Cats released Adams in June, ostensibly because they had signed Manziel to a two-year contract. Adams then signed with the Alouettes as a free agent, only to watch the team trade for Manziel. But before Thursday night’s game, he seemed to accept the fact that he would soon become the team’s backup, offering up much more measured comments than the “never again” diatribe he delivered after the loss. “Everybody knows Johnny didn’t come here to sit. They didn’t pay him just to sit. I understand he’s coming here to play,” Adams said. “As of right now, the Alouettes are [1-5]. I’m worried about winning a game. I’m not worried about what Johnny’s doing. “Coach gave me the start. I’m going to come out here, do my best, lead this team, be efficient on second down and just have fun. When I have fun, I play my best.” Manziel, who was not made available to reporters, apparently still has some work to do to get up to speed, though he said he was “getting there”:   #AlsMtl Day 2 prep, defence ramping up speed and it shows.

But now we have this opportunity to make other parents’ days different,” Miller’s wife, Morgan Beck Miller, said in a “Today” show interview that aired Monday morning. Emeline, known as Emmy, was 19 months old when she died June 10, the day after falling into a neighbor’s pool in Southern California in an accident her father said happened “in the blink of an eye.” It had been an ordinary day, Emmy’s mom, a professional beach volleyball player, recalled in the tearful interview. “Every morning, the kids would go swimming and Bode would go swimming with them, and they’d be in there for hours. And they loved it,” Morgan Miller said. After attending a birthday party, Morgan and Emmy stopped at home, where Bode was leaving to take his oldest daughter to a softball game.\\xa0(The couple has a son together and is expecting another child in October; Bode Miller has two children from other relationships.) “He was loading up the car when we got back and I gave him a kiss. And out of nowhere, [Emmy] leaned over and gave him another kiss. And we were so amused by her reaction because it was not typical of Emmy,” Morgan said. “So I kissed him again and she did it again and we laughed. Then I turned around and I walked inside and she waved and said bye to her dad.” She and her children then headed for their neighbors’ home. “We go over, back and forth, multiple times a week. They’re family to us,” Morgan said. “And it was just a normal day over there. We sat on the sofa, and she played in front of us.” With other kids playing nearby, “Emmy would go back and forth, which was all of 15 feet. And all of a sudden, it was just too quiet for me. We’re in mid-conversation and I stood up. And I turned and I went right to where the boys were and I said, ‘Where’s Emmy?’ ” Emmy’s father, an Olympic gold medalist in Alpine skiing, described her as “a bear” who “had such a powerful bull-like personality where she just did what she wanted.” That made the silence even more alarming. “Before Nate [their son] could respond, I turned around and the door that leads to the backyard, that was closed, had this tiny sliver of light coming through the side,” Morgan Miller said. “And my heart sank and I opened the door and she was floating in the pool. And I ran and I jumped in.” She started CPR, and the neighbor called 911. Although it initially appeared as if the baby might survive, “the doctor said her brain had just not had enough oxygen for too long of a time,” Bode Miller said. The Millers’ story is one that is familiar to all too many parents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified drowning as\\xa0the leading cause of death from unintentional injuries for children aged 1 to 4. The Millers had taken precautions, making sure their pool is surrounded by a fence. Now, they want to raise awareness. “We have the choice to live our days with purpose,” Morgan Miller said, “to make sure that no other parent has to feel what we’re feeling.”       We want to thank our friends, family and every one of you who sent a message, said a prayer or donated for the overwhelming expression of support - we are truly touched and blessed. Our midwives started a gofundme campaign to raise funds and we intend to donate these funds raised to worthwhile causes connected to water safety education. We are inspired to make our baby girls memory go forth and help prevent as many drownings as possible. We will post more soon on our plans and efforts.

The Baltimore Ravens traded up to select Jackson in the first round of this year’s NFL draft because of his success at that position. Yet when Baltimore kicks off its preseason slate with the Hall of Fame Game against the Chicago Bears on Thursday in Canton, Ohio, Jackson will be seeking to prove the simple fact that he is indeed still a quarterback. “That’s the first thing I want to show,” said Jackson, whom some NFL teams reportedly wanted to see work out as a wide receiver. “Just show my growth from college to my new chapter in life.” [A soccer player from Norway who once had a 92-yard punt has impressed at Ravens camp] Jackson, who won the Heisman as a 19-year-old sophomore in 2016, is behind veteran mainstay Joe Flacco on Baltimore’s depth chart. Flacco has been the Ravens’ starter for the last 10 years and led the team to a Super Bowl win after the 2012 season. With Flacco, however, the Ravens have missed out on the playoffs the past three years, and Jackson represents the team’s future if he is able to adjust to the NFL game. In preparation for his Ravens debut Thursday, his first live action since the TaxSlayer Bowl in December, Jackson said he has been practicing calling plays in front of the mirror. Ravens offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg said he will be looking to see if the adjustments Jackson has made in practice translate to the game environment. Sometimes, he said, players at any position can revert to old habits once they’re in a game situation. “I’ll probably have butterflies — my first NFL game,” Jackson said. “It’s not a real game, but it counts for me. Definitely butterflies. I can’t wait. I’m really anxious.” [Johnny Manziel to make first CFL start for Montreal Alouettes on Friday] Jackson cemented himself as an electric running quarterback at Louisville. Through his three years in college, Jackson accumulated more than 4,000 yards on the ground and 50 rushing touchdowns — in addition to more than 9,000 passing yards. But in the NFL, he will have to be smarter about when he decides to take off. That’s what Ravens backup Robert Griffin III had to learn when he entered the league as a mobile quarterback with the Washington Redskins in 2012. “I feel like he’s my little brother, but I’m not going to try as the big brother to tell him don’t do this,” said Griffin, whose Redskins tenure was derailed after he suffered a major knee injury at the end of his rookie season. “He’s going to have to learn some things on his own as he’s out there and he’s working. I think he’ll figure it out pretty quickly, and he’ll still be the dynamic player that he is.” Griffin described new quarterbacks coach James Urban as someone who “doesn’t try to coach the playmaker out of you.” There are times to push for extra yards, but there are also times to just get down, Griffin said. Griffin had to fight against his competitive nature to not treat every play like it was the last one of the game. He has talked to Jackson about the quicker pace of the NFL, and Jackson will start to learn firsthand beginning Thursday. “He’s got the tools and everybody around him to help him be successful,” Griffin said. “I think he’s been great about it, with listening. We’re just trying to teach him how to be a pro.” More on the NFL: Richard Sherman says Jerry Jones has an ‘old plantation mentality’ about anthem policy Dallas sportscaster rips Jerry Jones for his anthem stance and for not following it himself Panthers DB Ross Cockrell suffers an injury so horrible you could hear it ', 'Lamar Jackson did it all in college.

(Patrick Smith/Getty Images)   by Dan Steinberg July 30 Email the author   The resurfacing of old tweets containing offensive language has, in recent months, created ripples in college basketball (Donte DiVincenzo) and the NFL (Josh Allen), to say nothing of the entertainment and political realms. Major League Baseball now is in the spotlight, with successive news stories on years-old tweets sent by Brewers reliever Josh Hader, Braves pitcher Sean Newcomb and Nationals infielder Trea Turner. Those stories have prompted many, both inside and outside pro sports, to wonder why professional athletes don’t delete their entire Twitter histories when they become famous, eliminating any potentially offensive messages from the Internet. “If you’re on Twitter, please spend the five minutes it takes to scrub your account of anything you wouldn’t want plastered next to your face on the front page of a newspaper,” Cubs pitcher Jon Lester tweeted on Monday. “Better yet, don’t say stupid things in the first place. Too many young guys getting burned. …\\xa0Listen I’m far from the sharpest tool in the shed and there’s certainly no halo above my head (pardon the rhyme) but I know some of these guys are great dudes who just had lapses in judgment.” Lester clarified in subsequent tweets that he was not excusing any of the tweets in question, nor was he defending their authors. But his thought was a natural one, and a close cousin to another question being asked this week: With all they have to lose, why would professional athletes be on social media to begin with? [Svrluga: When an athlete’s ugly tweets hit home, ‘it feels like an actual gut-punch’] An answer to that particular question came Monday evening from Nats closer Sean Doolittle, in a lengthy and much-lauded string of messages. Doolittle’s basic thesis: Baseball needs to concern itself with the message, not the medium, and the message hasn’t always been good enough. “It’s been a tough couple of weeks for baseball on twitter,” Doolittle wrote. “It sucks to see racist and homophobic language coming from inside our league — a league I’m so proud to be a part of that I’ve worked really hard to make a more accepting and inclusive place for all our fans to enjoy.

Social media can be great for an athlete. I met my wife on twitter (long story). It helps athletes share their stories and personalities and connect with their community. Besides, it’s not like you can accidentally post a slur.” A brief aside: Doolittle wasn’t joking about meeting his wife on Twitter. He and Eireann Dolan retold the story of their online romance to The Washington Post’s Chelsea Janes this spring:  Fittingly, Doolittle and Dolan met on Twitter, a story they recalled fondly last week on the patio behind the Nationals’ complex. Dolan was friends with Doolittle’s teammate Brandon McCarthy. Doolittle would reply to their tweets now and then, not thinking much of it. After weeks of public replies, Dolan sent him a puzzling message — “Why are you funny?” “I was mad he was funny, because I don’t like when people are good at two different things,” Dolan said. “You should be good at baseball or you should be good at being funny online. He was both, and I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t care for this at all. You need to pick a side.’” Because he wouldn’t pick just baseball, they ended up on the same side in the end.  (If you’ll tolerate another brief aside, turns out your humble author also met his wife on Twitter. Thanks to a shared interest in, of all things, the Washington Wizards. And now we have a chubby little toddler girl with a dresser full of D.C. sports gear. So don’t say the Wizards, and Twitter, haven’t created any happiness in this crazy, mixed-up world.) Anyhow, back to Doolittle. “A lot of the tweets that have surfaced are from several years ago — from a time in their lives when they may not have realized the impact those words have,” he wrote. “But as you learn from and grow out of that youthful [indiscretion], delete those posts to reflect that growth.\\xa0Between all the people you meet and the places you go, there is a lot of opportunity for personal growth in baseball. It’s entirely possible that those old posts no longer reflect that person’s views. But actions will speak louder than words. “It’s a reminder that words matter, and that the impact the of words matter more than the intent. Rather than feeling like this platform makes us targets and we have to censor ourselves, find a way to use the platform to lift others up and make a positive impact.\\xa0It can be tough for athletes to understand why these words are so hurtful. Most of us have been at the top of the food chain since [high school], immune to insults. When all you’ve known is success and triumph it can be difficult to empathize with feeling vulnerable or marginalized. [Nationals’ Trea Turner is the latest MLB player to have ugly tweets uncovered] “Homophobic slurs are still used to make people feel soft or weak or otherwise inferior — which is [BS],” Doolittle wrote. “Some of the strongest people I know are from the LGBTQIA community. It takes courage to be your true self when your identity has been used as an insult or a pejorative.” (Another aside: Doolittle and Dolan have long been outspoken supporters of MLB pride nights, donating hundreds of tickets to the Oakland A’s pride night to\\xa0LGBT youth groups, recording a promo for this year’s Nats night\\xa0and visiting\\xa0SMYAL, a support and mentoring group for D.C.-area LGBTQ youth.

I hope we can learn from this and make the MLB a place where all our fans feel welcome.” While some fans and media members have found the recent apologies lacking, Doolittle earned enthusiastic praise for his remarks, which were widely shared on Monday.   sean doolittle is a great human— Janiece 🦄 (@feelingamazing) July 30, 2018      This is the thread I need from a major league ballplayer.

Except for the reliever who tossed his glove to the ground and glared into the dugout in the ninth inning of a 20-run game. And the reliever who was traded because, according to people with knowledge of the team’s thinking, he had been too critical of the club’s inner workings and clubhouse culture. And the starter and the closer who are still on the disabled list. And here’s the manager’s assessment: “I had a couple [players] pop their heads in today already and say, ‘We’re in,’\\u2009” Dave Martinez said. “We’re good. Everything’s good.” Really? The Nationals are in the section of the season that will determine whether they will establish relevance or fade into oblivion, and not everything is good. Yes, they beat the comically bad New York Mets, 5-3, Wednesday afternoon, and they’re back above .500 — at least for the moment. If the remaining 50-something games were against the Mets, well, then, yeah, maybe everything’s good. The reality, though, is this: These Nationals are fragile, and the man in the lead chair at the moment is made of porcelain. Martinez has not alienated the clubhouse — this is not a Matt Williams-in-2015 moment, not at all — and he has significant pockets of support, both in the dugout and the front office. [Another day, another drama, and the Nationals hold off Mets, 5-3] But for all the games Martinez played — 1,918 in the majors, over 16 seasons — and the decade he spent as a big league coach, he has never occupied his current seat, and it shows. With their season set to either take off or implode, the Nationals are in a position in which they must protect their rookie skipper, rather than be led by him. “You ask every manager that’s been in here: I’m in support of the manager at all times,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said Wednesday. “He’s the leader. He’s the leader in that clubhouse. I think Davey’s leading in a terrific manner.” Except here’s the thing: The Nationals’ roster histrionics both before and after the trade deadline had to do with shoring up clubhouse support around that leader at least in part because Martinez couldn’t shore it up on his own. First came Tuesday’s trade of reliever Brandon Kintzler, which had its genesis in the belief Kintzler was too free with clubhouse information and criticism, according to people with firsthand knowledge of the situation. In various pockets of the clubhouse, that move was met with frustration, indifference and satisfaction. More to the point, though, was the mess at the end of a mess Tuesday night. The Nats held a lead over the Mets of — get this — 25-1. Shawn Kelley’s job, in that moment, is to get three outs. It is not to become obsessed with the umpiring crew, which was messing with Kelley’s pace of play. Kelley gave up a three-run home run. With the Nationals up by 21 runs, he threw his glove to the ground. More important: He glared into the dugout. Did the Nats think he was showing up the manager? “I did,” Rizzo said. “For me, no,” Martinez said. [Mike Rizzo delivers a message for Nationals: ‘If you’re not in, you’re in the way’] The GM chose a side, and chose hard. The manager equivocated, because he does not want to upset the apple cart — even if the apple about which he was worried already had been jettisoned. Rizzo clearly felt the need to step in. He and Martinez and other Nats coaches and executives talked about Kelley long into the night after the blowout Tuesday. They decided to blast Kelley to the moon. “It was pretty cut-and-dried,” Rizzo said. “I thought that the act that he portrayed on the field last night was [a] disrespect to the name on the front of the jersey, the organization — specifically, Davey Martinez.” They told Kelley: You’re cut. Martinez said, “It stinks,” and he got just two hours of sleep. Rizzo neither tossed nor turned. There’s no problem with an organization jettisoning employees because they publicly embarrass leadership. But the point here is that the Nationals either couldn’t or didn’t shore up either of these issues internally. Kintzler and Kelley might not have been the most prominent pieces in a bullpen that must produce if the Nats are to climb back into the National League East race. But that bullpen is without injured closer Sean Doolittle, and that puts more strain on all the other parts; Ryan Madson and Kelvin Herrera each gave up solo homers Wednesday. Both Kintzler and Kelley were useful, and they’re essentially not here for the same reason: In the estimation of some Nats decision-makers, they either publicly or privately brought the manager’s leadership into question. And so, in the middle of this maelstrom, sits a 53-year-old baseball man who’s a bazillion games into his baseball life but just 107 games into his managerial career. This can’t just be about Dusty Baker no longer being here or about hiring someone who had never managed. Shoot, half the division leaders in baseball are managed by men who had no prior experience in the position: Alex Cora in Boston, Gabe Kapler in Philadelphia and Torey Lovullo in Arizona. Throw in Aaron Boone, in his first year with the Yankees, and Dave Roberts, now in his third year with the Dodgers, and there’s plenty of precedent for first-time managers to excel. “I just think he’s a manager that you’re able to talk to each and every day,” said Martinez’s most vocal supporter in the dugout, Nats star Bryce Harper. “His door is wide open. He’ll do anything he can for anybody in this clubhouse.” [Ryan Zimmerman couldn’t stop smiling during Mets shortstop Jose Reyes’s pitching debut] Such support is important. But it’s also worth pointing out that Martinez did not bench Harper when the slugger failed to run out a groundball last month in New York but did bench Trea Turner following a similar occurrence last week in Miami. Players pay attention. They particularly home in on discrepancies. And what they’re watching is a manager who’s still learning — not the game, and not how to relate to people, but how to take charge of situations that might otherwise fester. The coaching staff and front office have to help. But the manager must take charge. “What I’ve learned is [be] patient,” Martinez said. “I think I’ve been very patient in adversity. .\\u2009.\\u2009. For me, it’s about taking care of the seconds, and the minutes, hours and days will take care of themselves.” The seconds have, at times, seemed to move pretty quickly for Martinez. Yet in the midst of all this, the Nationals won two ballgames they needed to win. “Everything is behind us now,” Martinez said. “The trade deadline — everything. I’ve told those guys, I said, ‘If we play baseball like we’re capable of playing, this is going to be really interesting.’\\u2009” It’s already interesting. And really, everything they want is still in front of them. What they’ll find out is whether the man obsessing over those seconds can help make the days and weeks to come matter.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)   by Chelsea Janes August 1 at 7:02 PM Email the author   The message is clear now, delivered first by the trade of Brandon Kintzler on Tuesday, then emphatically when the Washington Nationals designated Shawn Kelley for assignment early Wednesday morning. “If you’re not in, you’re in the way,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said hours after the latter move, acknowledging that the reason he sent both men packing was his feeling that they were undermining clubhouse culture. [Mike Rizzo had to shore up the Nationals’ clubhouse, because Dave Martinez couldn’t] The Nationals had weighed their options at Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline following a disappointing start to the season. They considered selling more expensive veterans such as Kelley, and had multiple trades involving multiple players, including Bryce Harper, in place Monday night before ownership backed out, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Rizzo said he and the front office decided they had to give this roster a chance to turn things around. Nationals principal owner Mark Lerner wrote a public letter Wednesday acknowledging the team’s struggles while solidifying ownership’s position. “In spite of a player payroll that exceeds $200 million — the second highest in baseball — and exceeding the luxury tax threshold, so far this season has not lived up to everyone’s expectations,” Lerner wrote. “The trade deadline forced us to take a hard look at the roster and contemplate whether to keep the team we have for the remainder of the season or make significant changes. “At the end of the day, my family and Mike Rizzo decided that we just couldn’t give up on this team We couldn’t look ourselves in the mirror knowing that we had simply thrown in the towel on a team full of talent and heart.” [Nationals owner Mark Lerner pens letter to fans: ‘We just couldn’t give up on this team’] Going forward — and changing the clubhouse culture — came down to the two decisions the Nationals did make this week. Kelley threw his glove and glared into the dugout after allowing a home run to Austin Jackson in what had been a 25-1 game Tuesday night. He said afterward that he was frustrated with umpires missing calls and prodding him on his pace. Manager Dave Martinez, protecting his player, said he believed that’s all it was. Rizzo said he saw what many who noticed Kelley’s glare inferred. Kelley was frustrated to be pitching in a game such as that one in the first place, and he showed up his manager. His agent, Mike McCann, later told ESPN Kelley was hoping Martinez would argue on his behalf. Rizzo thought differently. “I [interpreted as Kelley frustrated to be in the game]. It may not have been, but that’s the way I looked at it,” Rizzo said before the Nationals’ 5-3 win Wednesday over the Mets.\\xa0 “After what happened before the game [Tuesday], getting ready for post-deadline season, I thought it was truly a day we should have been happy and celebrating — we had a big win against a division rival and felt good about ourselves — and such a selfish act is not what we’re here for.” The Nationals signed Kelley to a three-year, $15 million dollar deal before the 2016 season. In his 2 1/2 years with them, he grew into a beloved clubhouse presence, a jovial guy who made newcomers feel comfortable. After Kelley’s outburst Tuesday night, Max Scherzer and Ryan Madson spoke with Kelley in hushed tones, the kind of conversation they do not usually have with veteran teammates after bad performances. Obviously they noticed his reaction. Everyone did, and Rizzo believed he had to move. In the wake of the renewed commitment to this season, from the top down, Rizzo said he could not allow anyone to undermine the state of his clubhouse. “It’s pretty cut and dry. You guys all saw it. The act that he portrayed on the field last night was disrespectful to the name on the front of the jersey, the organization, specifically Davey Martinez,” Rizzo said. “And you’re either in or you’re in the way. And I thought he was in the way.” Kelley had bounced back from a brutal 2017 season and was pitching to a 3.34 ERA in 35 appearances. A person familiar with the Nationals’ plans said they listened to offers for the free agent-to-be before Tuesday’s deadline and they could still get something for him now that he has been designated for assignment. He is the second well-liked veteran to go in the last 24 hours, as Rizzo dealt Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs just before the deadline. People familiar with the situation said Rizzo confronted Kintzler about being the anonymous source for various reports that painted an unflattering picture of the Nationals’ clubhouse culture. Kintzler denied being that source in an interview on 106.7 the Fan on Wednesday. “I’ve never talked to that [author] Jeff Passan guy in my life, so that’s an interesting accusation,” Kintzler said on the show “Grant & Danny.” “I know for a fact that someone got him to admit his source was not a player, so it wasn’t me. I’ve never talked to that guy in my life.” Rizzo didn’t explicitly acknowledge that clubhouse culture was the reasoning behind the Kintzler deal but did not reject the premise when asked whether his decisions on Kintzler and Kelley represented a shift in mentality about players who undermine their manager. “We’ve always had that stance. We’ve always had a stance that if you’re not with us, you’re against us, and you’re in the way,” Rizzo said. “The culture here has been so good for so long. We’ve had so much success over the last seven years that we’re not going to let anybody interfere with that success .\\u2009.\\u2009. We’re not going to let any one person derail what we’re going to do.” Martinez seemed to struggle with the move, eyes welling for the second time in two days when he spoke about having to designate Kelley, whom he said he “respected” and “is not a bad person.” The Nationals will have to absorb the remaining portion of Kelley’s salary, unless another team picks him up on waivers, which seems unlikely. That, in itself, should demonstrate the frustration the front office felt at his outburst and the optics it created for a team already answering questions about its clubhouse culture. Without him, the Nationals have lost two of their most outspoken veterans in the bullpen, leaving Madson, injured Sean Doolittle and newcomer Kelvin Herrera as the longest-tenured members of that corps. “Those are two guys within our bullpen, two of our more vocal guys. They were vocal leaders, and they led that way,” Doolittle said. “Now it’s going to fall on somebody to kind of step up and assume that role.” The Nationals recalled right-hander Jimmy Cordero to replace Kelley on the roster. The 26-year-old is pitching to a 1.88 ERA in 38 games for Syracuse this season and has struck out more than a batter per inning. In Cordero and Wander Suero, the Nationals get two durable, versatile relievers who can provide them multiple innings. Kintzler and Kelley, as more veteran players with injury histories, limited Martinez’s options more. But jettisoning Kelley was not about on-field performance. Rizzo left no doubt about that.

(Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)   by Jorge Castillo August 1 at 11:25 AM Email the author   Brandon Kintzler did not report to Nationals Park on Tuesday afternoon thinking he had played his final game for the Washington Nationals. The trade deadline was approaching, but he thought he was safe. The reliever prepared for the club’s game against the New York Mets as usual. Then, about an hour before the 4 p.m. nonwaiver trade deadline, he was summoned to Manager Dave Martinez’s office. “Am I getting traded?” Kintzler asked. He was, he was told. Kintzler thought it was a joke. “Pretty shocked,” he said. After all the speculation swirling around the organization over the previous 24 hours, the only trade the Nationals completed before Tuesday’s deadline was shipping Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs, a National League playoff contender, for Jhon Romero, a minor league right-hander who hasn’t pitched above Class A. He owns a 3.27 ERA in 32 relief appearances for the Cubs’ high-A affiliate. He isn’t helping the big league club anytime soon. [Bryce Harper on Nationals considering trades: ‘Glad I’m still inside this clubhouse’] On the surface, trading Kintzler for a low-level prospect while keeping the rest of the team intact to make a run for a postseason berth is not sensible. The Nationals acquired Kintzler at the deadline exactly a year earlier as part of their midseason bullpen overhaul. He teamed up with Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson to solidify Washington’s relief corps last year. He was a valuable piece last season and has been this season. He has a 1.88 ERA in 14 1/3 innings since June 28. That was good enough for the Cubs, the National League Central’s first-place club, to add him. “I felt like I was throwing the ball well,” Kintzler said. “I can go help a contender, another contender, right now. I don’t know. Just shellshocked right now. At a loss for words.” The Nationals gave their reasons for trading Kintzler publicly, but a significant reason went unspoken. Club officials believed Kintzler was an anonymous source for reports that cited clubhouse strife, according to people with knowledge of the situation. In a radio interview on 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday, Kintzler denied he was a source for Yahoo’s recent story, which called the Nationals’ clubhouse “a mess.” “I’ve never talked to that [author] Jeff Passan guy in my life, so that’s an interesting accusation,” Kintzler said on “Grant & Danny.” “I know for a fact that someone got him to admit his source was not a player, so it wasn’t me. I’ve never talked to that guy in my life.” Martinez said the reason Washington traded Kintzler was to give the spot to Wander Suero, who can pitch multiple innings and provide length. Suero was called up from Class AAA Syracuse about an hour before Tuesday’s game against the Mets. Martinez said the club figured Madson, recently acquired Kelvin Herrera and Sean Doolittle, whenever he comes off the disabled list, composed a strong enough back end. Dealing from that surplus allowed the team to address another need, Martinez explained. “I think that’s missing in the bullpen,” Martinez said. “Look, Brandon was awesome. He got some big outs for us, he really did. Of course, he’s going to be missed in the bullpen, but I think moving forward having some length to go with [Matt Grace] is important. It really is.” Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said he believed Suero deserved a spot in the majors and will be a vital piece in the future. The 26-year-old Suero has pitched to a 3.15 ERA in 16 games in a couple stints for the Nationals this season. He lasted appeared in a game for Washington on July 14, when he tossed 2 2/3 scoreless innings. [Svrluga: Nats hang on to Bryce Harper at deadline as Mike Rizzo bets on horses he rode in on] Rizzo hinted that Koda Glover, who has made eight minor league appearances after missing the season’s first four months with a shoulder injury, could join the team soon to bolster the bullpen. He also suggested moving Kintzler was, to some extent, financially motivated. Kintzler has a mutual option for next season; if the team doesn’t pick up a $10 million team option, he can pick up a $5 million player option. “It gives us financial flexibility, this year and next year going forward,” Rizzo said. “And we felt it was the prudent move, like all the moves we make, with 2018 and beyond in mind.” That mutual option is part of the contract Kintzler signed with the Nationals in December. He received offers on the table from other teams for more money and a more prominent role, but chose the Nationals because he liked the clubhouse and the organization. He felt at home. Teammates got along with him. He was close with Doolittle and Max Scherzer, often bouncing ideas off them.\\xa0 He played the role of pitching coach, helping Tanner Roark and Gio Gonzalez with their mechanics during their struggles this season. His presence was felt. “He helped me a lot in my career just in the years that we spent together so I’m going to miss him,” Doolittle said. “We’re going to miss his ability on the field. I think we’re going to miss him in the clubhouse as well.” But he also rubbed some people the wrong way because he was willing to speak his mind more than others. Perhaps that was the lone\\xa0 factor in the Nationals’ decision. Regardless, Kintzler is a Cub now, and he didn’t see it coming. “In the beginning, you care because it’s your character,” Kintzler said. “I work really hard, I feel like, to be a good teammate. I always thought I was a good teammate and everyone in that clubhouse thought I was a good teammate. When someone tries to say something about your character as far as how you are in the clubhouse, that hurts a little bit, but it’s just an opinion of one person and they can think what they want. I thought I did a good job there. New beginnings today and it is what it is. Put it behind me and I can’t wait to face them next week.” Scott Allen contributed to this report.

(Rob Carr/Getty Images)   by Jorge Castillo August 1 at 6:31 PM Email the author   In a letter to fans, Washington Nationals principal owner Mark Lerner Wednesday acknowledged the organization seriously considered administering a roster makeover before Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline before deciding not to make wholesale alterations to a disappointing club that had been under .500 entering deadline day. “In spite of a player payroll that exceeds $200 million — the second highest in baseball — and exceeding the luxury tax threshold, so far this season has not lived up to everyone’s expectations,” Lerner wrote. “The trade deadline forced us to take a hard look at the roster and contemplate whether to keep the team we have for the remainder of the season or make significant changes. “At the end of the day, my family and Mike Rizzo decided that we just couldn’t give up on this team. We couldn’t look ourselves in the mirror knowing that we had simply thrown in the towel on a team full of talent and heart.” [Mike Rizzo delivers a message for Nationals: ‘If you’re not in, you’re in the way’] Speculation over whether the Nationals would buy, sell or complete some combination swirled until Tuesday, with Bryce Harper at the center. Washington had multiple trades for multiple players, including Harper, in place Monday night but ownership backed out, according to people with knowledge of the situation. The club then informed Harper, whose name was circulating in rumors, that he wasn’t getting moved. “I think whenever you hear your name or see your name on stuff you always wonder,” Harper, a free agent this winter, said Tuesday. “But I think that’s just the business end of the game, it’s part of the game and other teams are trying to get better and it’s just something that came up. [I’m] glad I’m still inside this clubhouse.” [Bryce Harper on Nationals considering trades: ‘Glad I’m still inside this clubhouse’] The only trade the Nationals made Tuesday was sending reliever Brandon Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs for a low-level minor leaguer — and on-field performance wasn’t the main motivation behind the move. Otherwise, the Nationals stood pat. They’ve gone 2-0 since then, beating the flailing New York Mets to a pulp, but even that didn’t come without Shawn Kelley spiking his glove in frustration after giving up a three-run home run in the ninth inning of a 25-4 win Tuesday. Rizzo decided the act was worth designating Kelley for assignment. [Svrluga: Mike Rizzo had to shore up the Nationals’ clubhouse, because Dave Martinez couldn’t] Kelley’s departure wasn’t part of the deadline calculus, but the Nationals are moving on without him. The rest of the team, after some careful consideration, remains intact. “The business of baseball is not always pretty,” Lerner wrote. “These are tough decisions — decisions that our organization does not take lightly.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)   by Scott Allen August 1 at 10:25 AM Email the author   Things got weird on the Mets’ TV broadcast during the eighth inning of the Nationals’ record-setting, 25-4 victory Tuesday night — and that was before New York shortstop Jose Reyes made his pitching debut in the bottom of the frame. “With the score and the weather and everything being as it is, we are going to unveil another edition of what we like to call Media Guide Musings,” SNY analyst Gary Cohen said as Kevin Plawecki stepped in against Nationals pitcher Wander Suero with the rain falling and Washington leading 19-1 to start the inning. “This is going to be a collaborative effort. We’re going to start on page 420 of the Mets’ media guide, the postseason section. The first page of the postseason section is the 1969 League Championship Series, Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets.” For the next six minutes, Cohen and his broadcast partners, Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez, stopped calling the ugly action on the field and read directly from the media guide. It was a history lesson from happier times for the Mets, and it was brilliant.    (Via MLB.tv)  “In the club’s first-ever trip to the postseason, the Mets swept the best-of-five series versus Atlanta, three games to none,” Cohen began as the theme from “Masterpiece Theatre” played in the background. “In Game 1, trailing 5-4 in the top of the eighth, New York rallied for five runs and a 9-5 win. Tom Seaver struggled, allowed five runs in seven innings, but earned the victory. In Game 2, two-run home runs by Tommie Agee, Ken Boswell and Cleon Jones lifted the Mets to an 11-6 win. In front of 54,195 fans at Shea — I might add, parenthetically, I was one of them — New York advanced to the World Series with a 7-4 victory in Game 3. The lead changed hands three times before Wayne Garrett’s two-run home run in the bottom of the fifth put the Mets ahead 5-4. Nolan Ryan hurled seven innings in relief to pick up the win and complete the sweep. Boswell hit .333 with two home runs and five RBI, while Agee batted .357 with two home runs and four RBI. Hank Aaron cracked a home run in each game and drove in seven runs for the Braves. We’re going to move to page 422.” “Is it my turn to read?” Darling asked as the music continued to play and the booth continued to ignore whatever was happening on the field. “Page 422, if you have it at home, folks. This is the 1969 World Series, the Baltimore Orioles versus the Mets. The Mets, of course, won the series, 4-1. The New York Mets entered the 1969 World Series as heavy underdogs against Baltimore. After failing in Game 1, The Amazins rattled off four straight wins to earn their first championship just eight years after the franchise was born.” “It’s like a Seder,” Cohen said before Darling eventually passed the book to Hernandez. “A raucous Shea crowd of 56,335 watched the Mets shut out Baltimore, 5-0, in Game 3,” Hernandez said. “Tommie Agee hit a leadoff home run off Jim Palmer, the only leadoff home run the Hall of Famer would ever allow, to put the Mets on the board early.” [After a stress-packed deadline day, Nats hammer Mets in a laugher] Cohen wrapped up the impromptu story time by reading the guide’s account of the Mets’ World Series-clinching win on Oct. 16, 1969. By this point, there was one out in the inning and a runner on first. “Behind a 5-3 victory, New York’s lovable losers were champions,” he said. “The Orioles led 3-0 early, but home runs by [Donn] Clendenon and [Al] Weis tied the game. In the eighth, [Ron] Swoboda gave the Mets the lead with an RBI double. [Jerry] Koosman induced future Mets manager Davey Johnson to fly out to Cleon Jones in left field for the final out. Jones (Sport Magazine) and Weis (Baseball Writers of America) were the series MVPs. And so concludes page 422, the 1969 World Series.”  \\ufeff  Cohen and Co. previously passed the time during the late innings of yet another Mets loss by reading from the media guide\\xa0on July 10. Here are a few numbers from Tuesday’s game that would make good fodder for a future “Media Guide Musings” segment, perhaps as early as Wednesday’s matinee at Nationals Park. 7: Runs in the first inning for the Nationals, the most in the first inning by a National League team this season.

They had smashed the New York Mets to pieces less than 12 hours earlier, a blowout featuring all sorts of franchise records, but another cloud, the latest in a 72-hour storm front, was hanging over the locker that Shawn Kelley had occupied for 2½ seasons. Kelley wasn’t there anymore. His nameplate had been removed. His presence was erased and replaced by Jimmy Cordero because Kelley had spiked his glove and glared into the Nationals’ dugout out of frustration after allowing a home run in the ninth inning of Tuesday’s rout. General Manager Mike Rizzo designated Kelley for assignment a few hours later after trading Brandon Kintzler, whom the Nationals believed was a malcontent. Rizzo acted swiftly and defiantly. [Mike Rizzo delivers a message for Nationals: ‘If you’re not in, you’re in the way’] Unlike Tuesday night’s thrashing, Wednesday’s 5-3 matinee win over the Mets did not end on a sour note. It was as routine as a journeyman outdueling a bona fide ace gets. The Nationals pounced on Noah Syndergaard early, watched Tommy Milone sparkle over seven innings and added insurance in their last at-bats to give the new-look bullpen some breathing room. They’re back over .500 at 54-53 and stand five games out of first place in the National League East. A two-game sample size regularly proves to be fool’s good, but it’s a start for a stubborn club seeking to turn the corner down the stretch. “It’s going to take a village, and they know that,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “This is a pivotal time of year.” The Nationals didn’t unload another batch of fireworks following Tuesday’s historic showing, but they jumped out front on Syndergaard when Bryce Harper’s single up the middle in the first inning scored Trea Turner, who had stolen the first of his two bases to get in scoring position. Harper finished 2 for 4 and with a .226 batting average — the highest that stat has been since the middle of June. [Wednesday’s box score: Nationals 5, Mets 3] “He’s playing the way he’s capable of playing,” Martinez said. “He’s really doing well. And it really started in Miami [over the weekend] — using the whole field, not trying to do too much. And I told him, ‘Just play the game.’ He’s hustling everywhere. If he continues to do that, we’re going to have a lot of fun.” In the third inning, Anthony Rendon extended the Nationals’ lead to 3-0 with a two-run homer, his 16th of the season. Meanwhile, the 31-year-old Milone, a Mets castoff filling in for the injured Stephen Strasburg for a second time, was silencing the anemic New York lineup. The left-hander compiled six strikeouts through three innings. He kept the Mets scoreless until the fifth, when Jose Reyes, who had made his pitching debut the previous night, socked a solo home run. The homer was Reyes’s first since April 29 and his second this season, matching the total he allowed on the mound Tuesday. [Ryan Zimmerman couldn’t stop smiling during Mets shortstop Jose Reyes’s pitching debut] After pitching to an 8.56 ERA in 11 appearances for the Mets last season, Milone limited his former team to the one run across seven innings Wednesday. He compiled nine strikeouts, his most since 2013 and one short of his career high, and he didn’t walk a batter. “You know what? Milone made some pretty good pitches,” Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said. “Now, we probably should’ve been able to challenge him a little bit better, but he had a pretty nice change-up working. He elevated the fastball well, kind of went north and south on us, and executed his pitches. It’d be nice to put a little more pressure on him than we did.” The 97-pitch outing, which followed Tanner Roark’s strong start (one run in seven innings) Tuesday, extended the Nationals rotation’s recent success: Over the past week, Washington’s starters have the best ERA in the National League. It’s a tiny sample size, but it’s encouraging. The Nationals are a dangerous team when their starting rotation is good. They’re bad when it’s not. This season is evidence. Milone has contributed by allowing four runs in two starts across 12 innings during his second career stint with Washington. The games have been against the Miami Marlins and the Mets, the NL East’s bottom feeders, but Nationals starters not named Max Scherzer spent the previous two-plus months regularly tripping over teams all across the spectrum. “It’s huge. That’s exactly the spot you want to be in, really,” Milone said. “I’m excited to be here. I’m happy I’m getting this opportunity.” [Brandon Kintzler on rumors of clubhouse leaking: ‘That’s an interesting accusation’] Milone’s performance was necessary because Syndergaard settled in. Making his first start since coming off the disabled list following a bout with hand, foot and mouth disease, Syndergaard retired 12 straight batters after Rendon’s home run. He then surrendered a leadoff single to Daniel Murphy in the seventh inning but escaped unscathed. Syndergaard’s effort kept it a two-run game, a lead that Reyes halved with an eighth-inning solo home run off Ryan Madson for his 11th career multihomer game. Suddenly, the Nationals’ bullpen was in a high-pressure spot for the first time without closer Sean Doolittle and Kintzler. Madson did not yield another run, though, and Washington tacked on two to pad the cushion for Kelvin Herrera to handle the ninth inning. The Nationals needed the extra leeway when Herrera allowed a Wilmer Flores flyball to the warning track that a leaping Juan Soto knocked over the wall for a solo home run. Herrera then surrendered a double to Michael Conforto and walked Jose Bautista before getting Brandon Nimmo to ground into a game-ending double play. It wasn’t easy, but Herrera didn’t slam his glove, and the Nationals won again, this time without a bitter finish.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Kareem Copeland August 1 at 3:07 PM Email the author   Speed was the most commonly used word in Paul Richardson’s scouting report when the Washington Redskins signed him in free agency this offseason, but that wasn’t all that was on display Wednesday. The new $40 million man showed off his hands and some toughness on what may have been his best practice of training camp. He had a reception of about 30 yards when he ran past Josh Norman and outstretched parallel to the ground to haul in an Alex Smith pass. The 6-foot, 170-pounder got behind another pair of defensive backs earlier, but Smith overthrew him. He added another touchdown in a short-yardage period where he put a nasty outside-in move on cornerback Quinton Dunbar after bouncing back from getting the wind knocked out of him a couple of plays earlier. Richardson had another diving catch for about 20 yards during the workout. “I’m comfortable every day,” Richardson said. “I’ve been comfortable since I got here. We’re just connecting, making plays. I see the ball and try to go get it. “We’re just throwing it more. We see a lot of things on film we want to get to. I think today was a day we really wanted to make a point to get to those things. Alex made it a priority to throw some of those corner routes, throw some of those deep balls, and we connected.” [Josh Doctson injures his shoulder during Redskins practice] Many observers continue to be skeptical about Smith’s ability to throw the deep ball, but that hasn’t been an issue during camp. The top three receivers of Richardson, Jamison Crowder, and Josh Doctson (who went down with a shoulder injury during practice, but later tweeted “#imgood”) have all had strong camps, but there’s a bit of a gap between them and the rest of the rotation. Maurice Harris, Brian Quick, Robert Davis and Trey Quinn have all had their moments, but the team kept just six receivers last season. Some won’t make the 53-man roster, and special teams ability will play a role in that decision. “Very important, if one guy can stand out on special teams, then that’s your fourth — period,” Coach Jay Gruden said. “You know, we understand that we have to improve on special teams instead of just saying that on the podium or in meeting rooms, we’re going to have to commit to it by maybe keeping somebody that is better on special teams, but maybe not quite as polished at receiver. “A lot of teams do that, but usually your fourth guy is going to be more of a true wide receiver. Your fifth guy could more in that role. So, we’ll have to wait and see even as a backup returner, a flier or whatever it might be.” [Former Redskins safety DeAngelo Hall swears — literally — that he is now retired] Play of the day Richardson had a couple plays that could have fit here, but there was a Jordan Reed reception that fans loved for a couple of reasons. Reed had a five-yard diving touchdown catch in the back of the end zone from Smith on a third-and-goal situation, in a preview of a connection that could be fruitful during the season. Reed seemed to get more physical work Wednesday than before, going through an individual blocking drill early in practice. The diving touchdown showed some trust in those two toes that underwent surgery, and was a reminder of how valuable of a target he can be at 6-2, 245 pounds with soft hands. Anderson running wild Second-year linebacker Ryan Anderson surprised many when he ended up in coverage against speedy running back Chris Thompson. The diminutive third-down back came out of the backfield and turned up the sideline with Anderson trailing. But Thompson didn’t pull away and the 6-5, 265-pound Anderson ran with him stride for stride. Anderson has been dealing with back spasms in training camp, but is expected to see an increased role in 2018. “As a rookie, I think a lot of the guys have high expectations,” Gruden said of the 2017 second-round pick, “of their coming in and leading the league in sacks and tackles and forced fumbles and passes batted down and all that stuff. But in reality, you’ve got to earn your stripes, especially if you’re playing behind somebody of great quality like Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith. “So, he’ll get his work and we’ll continue to work him. The big thing for him is to put practices back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back together [and] continue to get better. But I see steady improvement and growth from him in the weight room, his weight, his effort, so I like where Ryan’s at.” Roster moves The Redskins signed free agent linebacker Dadi Nicolas. To make room on the roster, they waived offensive linemen Alex Balducci. Nicolas was drafted in the sixth round of the 2016 draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. The 6-3, 239-pounder played 11 games as a rookie, but ruptured his patellar tendon in the playoffs and did not play in 2017.

The Washington Redskins wide receiver was flanked by trainers and medical staffers as he walked past the trainers’ tent, then past the line of fans secured behind the rope partition and finally up the grassy incline toward the facility. It was a familiar sight for Redskins faithful: Doctson away from the action, again sidelined by injury. And it’s unclear when the promising receiver will return to action. Doctson’s latest setback — a shoulder injury — was the result of an on-field collision with cornerback Josh Norman, who was attempting to break up a pass thrown by quarterback Alex Smith. The Redskins didn’t announce the severity of Doctson’s injury, although a person familiar with Doctson’s status said the pass-catcher “is good,” despite initially being in pain. “I was just preaching on injuries, and we for sure can’t let him go down like that,” Norman said shortly after practice ended. “Ugh, that was tough to take.” Hours later, Doctson reassured fans on social media that he was okay, tweeting, “I’m good,” along with the prayer emoji. The team is expected to provide a medical update Thursday.   #imgood🙏🏾— Josh Doctson (@JDoc_son) August 1, 2018    While it appears the team may have avoided significant trouble in this case, the injury scare was a reminder of how important of a role health will play for an offense that is hoping to take a step forward this season under Smith. This is particularly true for Doctson, a big-play threat who missed almost his entire rookie season in 2016 after being drafted in the first round. The play took place with nine seconds remaining in the two-minute practice drill, when Smith targeted Doctson on a fourth-and-goal pass from the 5-yard line. The quarterback threw the ball toward the right corner of the end zone, but Doctson, blanketed by Norman, couldn’t haul in the pass with his outstretched fingers. When the receiver fell to the ground, Norman fell on top of him. And while Doctson stayed down on the muddy field, Norman stayed by his side. “Man, if [Smith] had thrown the ball right here, in his chest, I’m making a play going the other way,” Norman said, recalling the play and the collision that followed. “But he threw it out towards the pylon, so now instead of two hands, you’ve got to go with one hand to try to get the ball out through him. … I think when my hand got into it, we went down to the ground. He landed on his shoulder pretty hard. “It’s so hard to try to pull back off of that play when you’re a defender,” he added. “It’s a two-minute situation, and you know you’ve got to stop him in order to win the drill, but man. … If I would have known he was going to get hurt, yes, I would have gave up [on the play].” Wednesday’s injury scare comes on the heels of Doctson having to field questions about his Achilles’ tendon, which caused him to miss 14 games during his rookie season. Although he rebounded last year, playing a full season and catching 35 passes for 502 yards and six touchdowns, Doctson underwent a precautionary MRI exam two days before players reported to Richmond. He downplayed the procedure, telling reporters: “I’m good. It was nothing. Just a fine tuneup. … Every car gets an oil change, so you’ve just got to check yourself. I knew it was good. I was just checking things out, and I’m good to go.” But now there’s a chance Doctson could miss practice time with another injury, with only a week before the Redskins’ first preseason game at the New England Patriots on Aug. 9. “I think in the red zone is where he is going to be most dangerous,” Coach Jay Gruden said when asked about Doctson’s progression within an offense that spreads the football around. “That’s where we’re hoping that he can really dominate in that area of the field and some tight window throws on third down. Just continue to get better and better, and when the ball is there for him and he goes out and makes the tough catches.” Washington still has more than a month to prepare for its first regular season game, but with a new starting quarterback and higher self-imposed expectations on the field, the Redskins can’t afford to be down a player — especially Doctson. “A player like him, you definitely don’t want to do that,” Norman said, lamenting his role in Doctson’s injury. “You definitely want to keep him up, keep him fresh and healthy. He’s been ascending, rising and doing everything he’s supposed to do each and every day.” Doctson’s injury history is extensive, dating back to his college days when he fractured his left hand and left wrist, in 2015.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)   by Dave Sheinin August 1 at 5:00 PM Email the author   Irrelevant in their home market, adrift toward the cellar of their division and beset of late by pitching maladies both typical (forearm tightness) and pre-adolescent (hand, foot and mouth disease), the New York Mets seem to exist these days for the sole purpose of making every other team in baseball feel better about itself. Yes, the Washington Nationals just endured a 24-hour period in which their franchise player was subject to incessant trade rumors, their young shortstop made a tearful apology for insensitive tweets and a reliever was jettisoned after spiking his glove during a 21-run blowout. But at least they’re not the Mets (who, it should be noted, were on the wrong end of that 21-run blowout). The statement, and the sentiment behind it, can be extended to just about any team. Yes, the Baltimore Orioles have the worst record in the majors, are on pace for the most losses of any team in 15 years and in the past two weeks traded six cornerstone players for mostly prospects. But they appear to have a plan — so, again, at least they’re not the Mets. It would be unsporting to pick on the Mets at such a low point in their season — a 5-3 loss to the Nationals on Wednesday at Nationals Park completed a two-game mini-sweep and dropped the Mets to 44-61 and into a tie for last place in the National League East, pending the Miami Marlins’ result at Atlanta on Wednesday night — except they have an uncanny, maddening way of bringing it upon themselves. [Mike Rizzo delivers a message for Nationals: ‘If you’re not in, you’re in the way’] Only the Mets, for example, would get two home runs out of their fill-in second baseman, as they did Wednesday from Jose Reyes, who took over for the injured Phillip Evans in the second inning, then be required to check on the state of his arm after eight innings in the field — because he had thrown 48 pitches of emergency relief in a franchise-worst 25-4 loss the night before. “A little sore in the back,” Reyes said, “but no big concern.” On Wednesday, the Twitter hashtag #ThatsSoMets was doing brisk business, as usual. The Mets were held to three hits and one run over seven innings by Nationals left-hander Tommy Milone, whom they let go in October after he went 0-3 with an 8.56 ERA for them in 2017. They sent left-hander Steven Matz, who lasted just two-thirds of an inning in Tuesday night’s debacle, home for an MRI exam on his ailing forearm. They got seven solid innings from Noah Syndergaard in his return from a bout of hand, foot and mouth disease but still lost. And none of that was the most inexplicable thing about this week for the Mets. On Tuesday, they somehow stood pat at the nonwaiver trade deadline — having already struck obvious, low-hanging-fruit deals for a pair of walk-year assets, closer Jeurys Familia and second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera, in the days leading up — despite being positioned as clear sellers and despite being flush with the type of pieces coveted by most contenders, namely controllable starting pitchers. Jacob deGrom, Syndergaard, Zack Wheeler, Matz — any of them, in roughly that order, could have been dealt for a significant return in a pitching-starved marketplace. And deGrom, in particular, could have brought back the type of package of prospects and young assets that could transform a franchise practically overnight. [Fancy Stats: Three teams with a better chance to make the playoffs after the MLB trade deadline] Instead, the Mets held on to all of them — plus other obvious trade assets such as Wilmer Flores, Jose Bautista and Devin Mesoraco — trumpeting what is apparently an organizational belief that the franchise can return to contention behind those same pitchers in 2019. In other words, the same thing they said last winter, and the winter before. “We’re interested in contending next year. We want to build around the pitching we have and have a winning team and compete for a playoff spot next year,” John Ricco, the Mets’ assistant general manager and one-third of the three-headed team running the club’s baseball operations since GM Sandy Alderson went on medical leave, said in a conference call with reporters following the trade deadline. “There was no deal on the table that we thought made sense at this point in time.” But then Ricco added this curious kicker: “That does not say anything about how we’re going to treat our assets heading into the offseason and how we’re going to plan for next year.” That made the Mets’ decision to stand pat for the most part sound less like a vote of confidence about 2019 and more like a punt to November. The clear implication is that the team’s owners didn’t want to entrust the three-headed interim troika of Ricco and special assistants Omar Minaya and J.P. Ricciardi with the tall task of overseeing a critical teardown that will go a long way toward determining the franchise’s direction for the next half-dozen years. Speaking again of the lack of deadline-day action, Ricco said: “I don’t think that necessarily means we’ve committed to one direction or another. What it does is, it gives us another two months to evaluate not only the players themselves but our club in general. It allows us to make a more informed decision this offseason with regards to the direction moving forward.” But it remains to be seen who the architect(s) of the Mets’ 2019 roster and direction will be: Ricco alone in a traditional GM role? The Ricco-Minaya-Ricciardi trio? A new, young and analytics-minded GM? That person, or people, will have to make decisions not only on roster makeup but also whether to bring back Manager Mickey Callaway, whose rookie season on the bench, notwithstanding all the injuries and intrigue, has been underwhelming at best. The fantasy of contending in 2019 would also seem to require more investment from ownership, in the form of free agent spending, to beef up an offense that ranked last in the majors in batting average (.229), 26th in on-base-plus-slugging percentage (.687) and 25th in runs per game (3.95) entering Wednesday. But will the Wilpon family have the stomach for another spending spree after those of the past two winters — when the Mets spent $166 million on multiyear deals for three hitters, outfielders Yoenis Cespedes and Jay Bruce and third baseman Todd Frazier, who have either been hurt or underperforming at the plate? All three reside on the disabled list, with Cespedes, who has two years and $58.5 million remaining on his five-year, $110 million deal, out for the season. All told, the Mets have some $87 million in 2018 payroll tied up in players on the DL. It may feel like piling on, but there is only one appropriate response to that: #ThatsSoMets.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Des Bieler August 1 at 10:40 AM Email the author   Rookies are eternally the shiny new objects in the NFL, but interest in them, particularly for first-round picks, is often out of proportion to their actual on-field production. By contrast, the opposite dynamic is frequently the case in fantasy football, where uncertainty over how large a role a given rookie might have and how well he might perform in it can cause him to slip in drafts. As such, rookies can present very nice draft values for those with the nerve to select them over more proven commodities. Of course, they shouldn’t be selected any higher than makes sense, so here is a guide to when drafters should think about taking the plunge on the top first-year players. For the purposes of this exercise, we’ll assume a 12-team league with PPR scoring. Running Back Saquon Barkley, Giants: First round I am on board with the real draft’s No. 2 overall pick\\xa0going as high as sixth in fantasy drafts, and possibly even higher in .5-PPR and standard formats. He should be in store for 300 touches. [The top fantasy players helped/hurt by offseason movement] Derrius Guice, Redskins: Fourth round The hard-charging back is set for early-down and short-yardage work, with some receiving upside, in a good offense. Ronald Jones, Buccaneers: Fifth round One of the most difficult players to forecast, Jones is likely to lead a committee and offers big-play ability. Sony Michel, Patriots: Fifth round We know New England loves to use a committee at RB, and while Michel has stiff competition for touches in Rex Burkhead and James White, there should be plenty of work to go around in a Tom Brady-led attack. Rashaad Penny, Seahawks: Sixth round Ever-upbeat Pete Carroll’s effusive praise for Chris Carson is less of a concern than Seattle’s general inability to run the ball. [The top five fantasy picks are obvious, but who’s No. 6?] Royce Freeman, Broncos: Eighth round Denver appears determined to keep Devontae Booker heavily involved, with\\xa0De’Angelo Henderson and others also vying for a piece of the pie. Kerryon Johnson, Lions: 10th round Could lose goal line carries to LeGarrette Blount and receptions to Theo Riddick on a team that has long favored the pass. Nick Chubb, Browns: 11th round Might spend the year as Carlos Hyde’s understudy. Nyheim Hines, Colts: 11th round Team wants to use speedy, undersized former WR all over the field, and he could be the primary pass-catching back. Jordan Wilkins, Colts: 13th round Skepticism about Marlon Mack feeds into widespread intrigue around Wilkins. As a late-round flier, he could pay huge dividends. Wide Receiver D.J. Moore, Panthers: 11th round First WR taken in real draft has looked good in training camp but could find consistent targets hard to come by this season. Michael Gallup, Cowboys: 11th round He has a real chance to become the leading receiver amid Dallas’s threadbare WR corps. Anthony Miller, Bears: 13th round Polished prospect is ticketed for a slot role and could see useful volume. Calvin Ridley, Falcons: 13th round Some advocates might be too quick to assume he’ll immediately push past Mo Sanu. Christian Kirk, Cardinals: 15th round Hardly out of the question that he emerges as Arizona’s No. 2 receiver behind Larry Fitzgerald. Tight End Hayden Hurst, Ravens: 16th round He was a first-round pick by a Baltimore team that, with Joe Flacco, has loved to throw to TEs. Mike Gesicki, Dolphins: 16th round Elite athlete pushing for a role in a Miami offense that lost high-percentage target maven Jarvis Landry. Mark Andrews, Ravens; Dallas Goedert, Eagles:\\xa0Two bonus picks here. Both make for decent fliers in very deep leagues. [Your fantasy league would be much better with these settings] Quarterback With the depth at the position, there’s not much reason to even think about these players in single-QB leagues, but in superflex or two-QB formats they could merit some consideration, in this order:  Sam Darnold, Jets: Most likely rookie to win starting job out of training camp. Josh Allen, Bills: Next most likely, but it would be surprising if he didn’t struggle to complete half his throws. Josh Rosen, Cardinals: Sam Bradford is the starter but, of course, is major injury risk. Baker Mayfield, Browns: Backing up Tyrod Taylor for time being, despite being No. 1 overall pick. Lamar Jackson, Ravens: Running ability would make him a hot pickup if he got the chance to start.

The moments with which these contributors fill those days are of their own choosing. But all of those moments were earned through the trial and toil of the past season, one that led to the first title in Washington Capitals franchise history. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Jason Franson/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nBraden Holtby\\nDay 30 | Lashburn, Saskatchewan\\nRoughly 5,000 fans lined up outside the Lashburn Sportsplex in Saskatchewan on Tuesday for the opportunity to snap a photo with hometown hero Braden Holtby and the Stanley Cup, the trophy the Capitals’ netminder had talked about winning since he learned to skate in the tiny farm town of Marshall about 10 miles to the northwest. \\n\\n \\n\\nHoltby signed autographs for three hours at the rink where he first played organized hockey and where a display commemorating his journey from Lashburn to juniors in Saskatoon to the NHL adorns one of the walls. It was the Lloydminster-native’s way of giving back to the place and community that shaped him into the Holtbeast he’s become. \\n“I never really thought twice about it,” Holtby told the My Lloydminster Now website of how he would spend his day with the Cup. “I grew up playing in Lashburn, that’s where I learned how to play and my dad coached basically every team I played for here. It was just a big part of our life growing up. It was nice to bring it back to your roots and I thought the town deserved it.”\\nOn Monday evening, Holtby, who regularly returns to Saskatchewan in the summer, posed for a photo with several family members, including his mom and dad, his wife, Brandi, their two kids, Ben and Belle, and the Stanley Cup in front of a grain elevator in Marshall. \\n\\n \\n\\nIt had been nearly two months since Holtby helped the Capitals clinch their first title in franchise history after an exhilarating postseason run that began with the 2016 Vezina Trophy winner on the bench. Philipp Grubauer outplayed Holtby for much of the regular season and earned the starting nod from Coach Barry Trotz in Washington’s first-round series against Columbus. But after the Capitals fell behind two-games-to-none, Trotz turned to Holtby in search of a spark. Holtby provided one, posting a .935 save percentage and a 1.92 goals-against average in Washington’s next four games, all of them wins. \\nThe soft-spoken and fashion-conscious goalie, who wore a cowboy hat, an unbuttoned shirt over a T-shirt and Birkenstocks on Tuesday, got stronger as the playoffs wore on and was at his best when his team needed him most. With the Capitals facing elimination in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Tampa Bay, Holtby made 24 saves for his first playoff shutout since 2016. Two nights later, he turned away all 29 shots he faced to help the Capitals advance to the Stanley Cup finals for only the second time.\\nHoltby was also responsible for one of the defining moments of the Capitals’ title run -- a play that will be talked about for years to come and, frankly, would look terrific painted on the side of Marshall’s grain elevator or the Lashburn Sportsplex. With Washington protecting a one-goal lead in the waning seconds of Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals, Holtby dove across the crease to stop Alex Tuch’s one-timer, which was bound for the back an apparently wide-open net.\\n\\n\\n\\nBraden Holtby cuts a Stanley Cup cake made by his cousin Janet Rogers, left.

Oshie\\nDay 23 | Warroad, Minnesota\\nT.J. Oshie landed at the small airport in Warroad, Minnesota – also known as Hockeytown, USA – around 9:30 local time on Tuesday morning. A police escort, complete with a community firetruck, waited for him. This was perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Washington Capitals forward to bring the Stanley Cup back to his hometown, and he wanted to do it in style. So he loaded his young family into a 1933 Lincoln limo, top down so he could wave and lift the Cup as the classic car made its way along Highway 33. The town’s massive digital billboard greeted him with a message – “Welcome Home, 77” – and included a photo of Oshie hoisting the cup. Now he was doing it in the flesh. \\nMost of the city’s youth players, along with hundreds of others, arrived at the arena in which Oshie starred in high school to see him with the Cup. The trophy wouldn’t have been there had it not been for one of their favorite sons. Oshie was a cornerstone of the Capitals’ championship run, a run that began with questions of whether or not Oshie was playing hurt. Early in the playoffs, he wasn’t even skating with the team in practices. \\nBut he played in every game. He scored 21 points and displayed a knack for elevating his offense at opportune times. He had six of his 13 goals on power plays alone; he scored goals in two of the final three games of the second-round series win over Pittsburgh, had two goals in a do-or-die Game-6 win over Tampa Bay in the Eastern Conference Finals and a goal and an assist in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals against Vegas. Those were crucial performances. Moreover, it was his usual feistiness and countless big hits that set the tone for a team that simply wouldn’t be denied.\\n\\n \\n\\nThere were other memorable moments off the ice during the run; Oshie endeared himself with his fan base by riding Washington’s Metro to Game 3 and 4 of the final series. He emotionally paid tribute to his father, who coached him growing up and has been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s, on the Vegas ice after the team won the Cup. And he was one of the more colorful personalities during the celebration back in Washington, making a habit out of chugging beers through the filter of his jersey pulled over his face, including as he delivered his address after the title parade. The party continued on Tuesday in Warroad. \\nCitizens from his community drank from the Cup. He held a toast for everyone who had shown up at a local bar, raising his Bud Light with a wide smile on his face. He stopped by the town’s water tower, emblazoned with two hockey sticks and considered something of a monument. He reminisced with his old friend Gigi Marvin, a gold-medalist with the U.S. Olympic women’s hockey team and who, along with Oshie, had been named royalty at the 2005 Warroad Frosty Festival, when both were still in high school. He sat down at one point to eat Cap’n Crunch out of the Cup. \\nHe planned to take the Cup to Minneapolis later in the day to share with teammates Shane Gersich and Travis Boyd, but before he returned to the small airport, he posed for countless more photos. That included one with the town’s mayor, who officially and proudly declared Tuesday, July 24, as “T.J.

Matt Niskanen had learned to play hockey at this facility, first in pee-wee and then in high school, so it only made sense that this would be the first stop for the Washington Capitals defenseman on his day with the Cup. \\nNiskanen wore a gray shirt with black shorts and black hat, almost blending in as he shook hands with countless citizens from the community. He had already shown an ability to relate to his fans during the Stanley Cup run during the spring, when he rode Washington’s Metro to Game 3 along with teammate and fellow Minnesota native T.J. Oshie; that only endeared him more with a fan-base that already recognized how valuable he was on the ice. \\nNiskanen was not only a centerpiece of Washington’s markedly improved defense during the postseason – but he also embodied the Capitals’ willingness to outwork teams down the stretch. One of his signature moments came at the end of the second period in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals against Vegas, when he outhustled the Golden Knights and created a short-handed breakaway. He was tripped by Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury on his way to the net, earning a penalty and providing a momentum-altering sequence in his team’s 3-1 win. His teammate, Jay Beagle, would later call him “our rock back there.” \\nWashington wouldn’t lose another game in the series, in large part because Niskanen – who also produced one goal and eight assists during the playoffs -- helped galvanize a roster that checked and blocked shots at every turn. It only made sense that he was gifted with the key to his hometown on Sunday.\\nAfter he was done posing for photos and taking the Cup to the middle of the arena at Miners Memorial Building, he eventually returned home and watched his young son, Charlie, use it as a bowl for some fruit snacks. \\n\\n \\n\\nAfter a decade of chasing the Stanley Cup – he had lost both in the Western Conference Finals with the Dallas Stars during his rookie year in 2008 and in the Eastern Conference Finals with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2013 before enduring several years of postseason heartbreak with the Capitals – Niskanen spent one of his final moments with the cup on the banks of Lake Vermillion, lifting the trophy over his head as the sun set, finally a champion. — Roman Stubbs\\n\\nRead more\\nBack to top\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (Washington Capitals)\\n\\nJakub Vrana\\nDay 10 | Prague, Czech Republic\\nThe night that ended with the Washington Capitals lifting the Stanley Cup began with a goal from Jakub Vrana. The speedy Czech winger skated down the left-center of the ice on a breakaway, then sniped a wrist shot over the glove of Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury. The goal put Washington ahead 1-0, a just reward for a player who had created numerous scoring chances throughout the Stanley Cup finals.\\nThat moment, and that night, triggered a chain reaction that helped introduce the Prague native to fans in his new home of Washington. On the Capitals’ first weekend back with the Cup, Vrana’s Instagram story helped detail much of the beer-drenched celebration – and provided a look at his new Stanley Cup tattoo. He further \\nendeared himself to fans\\n during the parade by shotgunning a beer from the top of a tour bus and professing his love for the fanbase during an impromptu radio interview conducted on a phone flung into that bus.\\nVrana both toned down and classed up his drinking when he reclaimed the Cup in his home city, most notably when he sprayed champagne into a crowd and eventually his mouth at a rally near the ice rink where he learned the game.\\nEarlier in the day he hosted a private gathering with friends and family at a favorite restaurant, the Cup sitting on a table surrounded by wide-bodied Bohemian beer mugs and trays of food. From there, Vrana and his mother brought the trophy to the cemetery in which his grandmother was laid to rest.\\nHe also squeezed in a trip to the hockey shooting range – a large rectangle of netting with a goal-sized yellow frame – where he refined his shot outside his apartment. It was that shot that gave the Capitals an early lead in the decisive game of the Stanley Cup finals.\\nVrana capped his time with the trophy at a Prague night club before it was shipped back to North America to continue its tour.

He carried it into the backyard, where his family and friends awaited with their phone cameras at the ready, eager to capture a moment that seemed inconceivable just five months ago.\\nKempny started the season with the Chicago Blackhawks, and by February, he was often out of the lineup for a team that was going to miss the playoffs. The 27-year-old was in just his second NHL season, and his career in the league was on life support. He was already considering returning to Europe and to play. \\nBut then he was traded to the Capitals in exchange for a third-round pick before the Feb. 26 trade deadline, and his smooth skating helped solidify what had been a porous Washington defense. En route to the franchise’s first Stanley Cup championship, Kempny scored two goals with three assists while skating more than 17 minutes per game. After his future in the NHL was in doubt earlier this year, Kempny signed a four-year, $10 million extension with the Capitals.\\nIn his backyard in Hodonin, a barrel served as the pedestal for the Stanley Cup, a small dog placed inside the bowl for photos. The next morning, he buckled the trophy into the passenger seat of his Ford Mustang convertible before arriving at his childhood rink. A drum line introduced him as he walked through the crowd, stopping so people could rub their hands on the names engraved in silver. His isn’t on there yet, but Washington’s roster will spend 65 years on the trophy.\\n\\n \\n\\nKempny’s next stop with the Stanley Cup was Brno, roughly an hour away from Hodonin. The drum line greeted him there, too, and highlights from Kempny’s career flashed across the videoboard. Kempny played in Brno for six seasons, from 18 to 24 years old.

Ovechkin grabbed the 35-pound cup and waited by the door, lifting it for Mikhail to touch as he walked in.\\nThey then hoisted it together.\\n“Kiss it,” Ovechkin told him. \\n“We waited 13 years,” Mikhail said after planting a smooch on the silver.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe night Ovechkin and the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas, Mikhail had been watching the game at the family’s country home in the Moscow suburbs. With the NHL app on his phone, he watches his son’s every game — and later the highlights — from the dining room television. Ovechkin typically calls his parents before every game, but despite the late hour in Moscow, he called Mikhail after Washington’s championship-clinching Game 5 win against Vegas. He told his father he loved him and he was thankful for everything he did to help him reach that point.\\n“It was something he was dreaming about,” Alex said. “That’s why he give so much help, so much of his time to me and it’s all about that.”\\n“I can’t even put it into words,” Mikhail said. “Thirteen years we were working toward that goal, and finally to win the Stanley Cup, it’s a huge happiness. Huge happiness.”\\nThe younger Ovechkin later carried the trophy up the stairs, where Dynamo has its museum. The signed jerseys and sticks of notable former players are in glass cases, and Ovechkin immediately picked out Capitals teammate Nicklas Backstrom’s display from when they played there together during the 2012-13 NHL lockout. \\nWith the Stanley Cup still in his grasp, he turned in place as his eyes scanned the room, perhaps considering that a photo of him visiting with the Stanley Cup soon would be proudly displayed. After he told a group of kids in Dynamo jerseys to follow their dreams and then posed for photos with the Stanley Cup, Ovechkin laced up skates and carried the trophy onto the rink where he once practiced, hoisting it up as someone on the bench warned him not to fall because the blades were dull. He then returned to the locker room, set the Stanley Cup down and clinked frosted mugs with Vorobiev.\\n“You know, Alex is a big star,’ Vorobiev said. “When he’s young, every guy who play with him, is working with him, he know he’s going to be a big star.”\\nThe Stanley Cup made its first voyage to Russia in 1997, the summer that Detroit won with five Russians, and Pittsburgh Penguins center Evgeni Malkin brought the trophy to Moscow the past two summers. But perhaps no player had higher hopes placed on him than Ovechkin, the first overall pick in 2004 who became one of the greatest goal scorers in NHL history. He first saw the trophy when he visited Toronto’s Hockey Hall of Fame as a Capitals rookie. Apparently unconcerned with superstition, he touched it.\\n“I knew one day we would win it,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlex Ovechkin posed with more than 3,000 fans at the World Cup Fan Fest as he toured his hometown with the Stanley Cup.

He set it on a table as he passed through a metal detector for a gathering of fans at the Moscow State University campus, there for a viewing party of Russia’s World Cup quarterfinal soccer game against Croatia. As he lifted it above his head for the crowd, one man yelled to him, “We’ve been waiting for you our entire lives.”\\nOvechkin posed for more than 3,000 photos as part of an event organized by the Putin Team, a social media movement Ovechkin started in November to support Russian President Vladi\\xadmir Putin.

He’s been waiting for this Cup for a long, long time.”\\nAfter a hectic and public first day with the trophy, Ovechkin chose to make Sunday more private. He took the Stanley Cup to a closed hockey game with high-ranking government officials, including Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev — but not Putin. He visited his family’s childhood apartment, laying with the trophy on the twin bed he used to sleep in. Then he and his parents went to the cemetery where his older brother, Sergey, rests after he died of a blood clot after a car accident when Ovechkin was 10. The Stanley Cup minders stayed in the car as Ovechkin carried the trophy to the headstone.\\n“It’s hard,” Ovechkin said. “But I think it was very important for me personally because he’s my brother obviously.

Queen’s “We Are The Champions” played as it made its entrance, and an atrium full of kids so sick they had to spend the Fourth of July at the hospital stood and cheered, phones up to capture photos of the hulking silver trophy and the man lugging it around for the day.\\nWashington Capitals defenseman John Carlson was the first player to get the Stanley Cup all to himself for 15 hours this summer, free to spend that time however he wished. He wanted it to stay in Washington, choosing to whisk the chalice from the Bethesda Firehouse to Children’s National Medical Center to a fundraiser in Bethesda before ending the night with a private party at Salt Line in Navy Yard.\\nIt was all very fitting for the 28-year-old who was drafted by the Capitals a decade ago. He has since met his wife Gina in Washington, started a family here and settled here, the only player who continues to live and train here for the duration of the offseason. He had already endeared himself to the area with a career year — 15 goals and 53 assists to lead all NHL defensemen in scoring during the regular season and five goals with 20 assists in the playoffs — but nine days after Carlson signed an eight-year, $64 million extension with the team, he further cemented himself as a true Washingtonian.\\n“I think everyone around and my family is going to celebrate it the same no matter where I was, but it’s nice to be able to enjoy it with the fans as well and to do pretty special stuff like this,” Carlson said.\\nThe Carlsons’s pediatrician is on the board at Children’s National, so they’ve felt a connection there and offered to bring by the Stanley Cup just 10 days earlier. Kids and hospital employees lined up to take photos with Carlson and the trophy, and for the ones who were too sick to get to the atrium, Carlson visited their rooms. One father offered congratulations to Carlson on his contract.

If the Caps can do it, if anybody can do it, we can, too. It just really has that kind of lift and appeal. Yeah, it’s hockey and it’s sports, but when you think about how that team came together and the city’s come together, Children’s National is proud to be part of it.”\\nCarlson was born in Massachusetts and played his youth hockey in New Jersey, but after his visit to the hospital, Carlson took the Stanley Cup to his Chevy Chase neighborhood, walking down the street to a yard where a small crowd had gathered to touch it and take photos with it. A five-minute drive away, a fundraising party had already started in downtown Bethesda to benefit the Michael Mosier Defeat DIPG Foundation, which raises awareness and provides research funding to treat aggressive brain tumors that targets children. Standard tickets were $20 each, and a line snaked under a tent to take photos with Carlson before he even arrived. The event ultimately raised more than $100,000 for Carlson’s cause.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn Carlson shows off the Stanley Cup to his neighbors in Chevy Chase, Md.

It’s just a good mix of both and doing the right thing and doing a fun thing. We’re all enjoying ourselves and raising a lot of money, so that’s kind of the best of both worlds.”\\nThe Stanley Cup got a respite from the heat at Carlson’s home, posted next to his sleeping son Rudy — appropriately born during the postseason — before a final stop on Washington’s Southeast Waterfront. Patrons surrounded the outdoor bar at Salt Line when a bus pulled up and the crowd that was inside for a private party emptied out of the restaurant with their phones raised for photos.

A ball pinged off an aluminum bat, then thudded into a glove. And then delirium — hats in the air, gloves tossed to the side, hugs all around. “It’s honestly overwhelming,” said Keith Barnes, the president of the Mamie Johnson Little League. “My heart,” said Charlie Sperduto, who directs the baseball and softball programs at the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, “it’s never been fuller than it was last night.” The transactional information isn’t mind-blowing: Mamie Johnson beat Capitol Hill to win the District’s Little League championship. The tournament has been held annually for 31 years. Someone has to win it. Next stop for the 12 boys from Mamie Johnson: Bristol, Conn., for regionals, with the Little League World Series in sight beyond that. That result, though, is enormously important not just for those kids and coaches but for baseball in Washington and beyond, too. This is the first all-African American team to win this tournament. Think about that and then listen to Barnes, who played high school and college ball — and wants other kids like him to one day say the same. “I got tired of reading articles about the decline of African Americans in baseball,” he said Wednesday morning. “And no one had solutions.”    Next stop for the 12 boys from Mamie Johnson: Bristol, Conn., for regionals, with the Little League World Series in sight beyond that. (Mamie Johnson Little League/Mamie Johnson Little League)  Guess what? He’s now part of the solution. This shouldn’t be happening. Not yet anyway. Five years ago, there was no Little League program in the District’s Ward 7, which is almost entirely east of the Anacostia River. Five years ago, the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy hadn’t opened its gleaming facility in the heart of that ward. Five years ago, baseball not only had almost no participation here, it really had no presence. “People were interested, but they didn’t really know how to cheer at a baseball game or how to act or where to stand,” said Raphael Lockett, who is in his third year coaching with Mamie Johnson and served as the head coach for the new champs, made up of 11- and 12-year-olds. “They called umpires ‘refs,’ stuff like that. Now they’re telling me, ‘Hey, Coach, why don’t you hit-and-run here?’ They’re going through situational baseball. They’re all into it, lights out.” Major League Baseball, you need to pay attention to what happened here Tuesday night. The Major League Baseball Players Association? Yep, you too. This isn’t just about one group of kids who won one tournament over one week. This is about the future of the sport. And it’s not about rolling out some bats and balls and saying, “Look! We’re supporting baseball in inner cities!” This is about a community-wide commitment to use baseball not just for baseball’s sake but to develop youth that might not otherwise be developed. In the short-term, the kids benefit from baseball. Years from now, baseball could be the beneficiary. “We have to fill the funnel,” said Tal Alter, the only executive director in Nationals Academy history and the character whose vision and commitment made a scene such as Tuesday night’s possible.    “It’s honestly overwhelming,” said Keith Barnes, the president of the Mamie Johnson Little League, said of the squad’s title. (Mamie Johnson Little League/Mamie Johnson Little League)  Alter and his staff are trying to fill that funnel with a fire hose. There are 700 kids in the academy’s “YBA Play” program, which provides fast-paced, nontraditional entry points in the sport that have helped kids get hooked. Eight of the 12 players on the Mamie Johnson team are academy kids, coming for holistic education programs after school during the academic year — STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and literacy education but baseball as well — and then spending their summer days at the facility. “They’re in that baseball culture like every day,” Barnes said. “That made it easier from those kids to buy in to what we’re doing.” What they’re doing — together — is saving a sport in the city. Barnes used the academy as ground zero to start his league from scratch, even though he has no kids of his own and wouldn’t be paid a dime. They started with 120 kids in 2015. This year, 310 registered. Barnes and his founding partners named the league in honor of Mamie “Peanut” Johnson, the first female pitcher to play in the Negro Leagues who happened to reside in Washington. It was a nod to history. But they were thinking of the generation to come. “When I watched baseball, I didn’t really understand it,” said 12-year-old Josh Young, the team cutup. “But I wanted to try it, to try and figure it out.” That became part of the mission for Alter, Sperduto and the academy staff. Sperduto teaches fundamentals by modifying rules, trying to suck kids into the sport. To fill the funnel, they need kids such as Solomon McKinney. Two years ago, he was obsessed with basketball and had never put on a baseball glove. On Tuesday night in the championship game, he tripled off the outfield fence. “He went from bouncing the ball,” Sperduto said, “to pounding the mitt.” But it isn’t just the pulls of basketball and football — or even video games and iPhones — that they’re battling. It’s the circumstances of their section of the city. “We’ve had setbacks after setbacks,” said Sperduto, a former college baseball player who has been with the academy since before the facility opened its doors. “Some kids have moved out, and we’ve lost some kids who had great potential because of family challenges. But our team here is relentlessly positive. We believe.” Package all that up, and there’s a chance for something special to happen not only for these families and these kids when they take the field again Aug. 5. This can be a model for other major league teams to use their brand and their brawn to reignite the sport in areas where, we have been told over and over, it’s dying. In 2017, African Americans made up just 7.1 percent of MLB’s Opening Day roster spots — the lowest percentage since 1958. (The figure jumped to 7.8 percent this year.) This is a socioeconomic problem because baseball is expensive and has become a white, suburban sport. The Youth Development Foundation sponsored by MLB and the players’ union believes enough in what the Nationals Academy is doing that it gave it $1\\xa0million over three years. But is that intractable? For the championship game, the academy’s rooftop was littered with tents that shielded an overflow crowd from the showers. The sidewalks were packed. Fans sat on the hills behind the outfield walls. They brought noise makers. Supporters from other leagues around the city came to see whether Mamie Johnson could pull it off. “That’s the biggest crowd I’ve ever seen,” said Langston Speed, also 12 and a middle infielder. Just that scene matters. Since Mamie Johnson formed, since the academy opened, a critical mass of kids has shown that there’s an appetite for baseball in just the kind of neighborhood where it had seemed to dry up. But winning? Winning matters, too. Last year, some of the Mamie Johnson kids were part of a team that lost in the D.C. final, blowing a four-run lead in the final inning. Johnson herself was there to see it. “Our guys came to the moment,” Lockett said, “and it was too much.” Over the winter, Johnson died at 82. So on Tuesday night, the kids from her namesake Little League began the most important game of their young lives by cheering, “For Mamie!” They wear little peanut patches on their uniforms. And this year, they won. The foundation is there. If it’s to grow, the result mattered. “We’ve had young kids already come up, parents already come up, from 5 to 7 years old saying, ‘I want to be that team. What can we do? Where’s the league sign-up? How can we play?’” Lockett said. “ ‘How can I play with my kids? What drills are you working on?’ It’s not, ‘Where’s the basketball goal?’ It’s, ‘Can I buy a bat for next year? What are the standards?’ It’s all changing.” Forget, then, any frustration with the Nationals’ losing record at the moment. Baseball — baseball at its best — is alive in the District. Alive and growing.  For more by Barry Svrluga, visit washingtonpost.com/svrluga.

(David ‘Dee’ Delgado/ for The Washington Post)   by Rick Maese July 28 Email the author   NEW YORK — When the last Philadelphia hero had been eliminated and left motionless on the animated map, the players removed their hands from the controls, confetti fluttered through the air and triumphant music blasted through the public-address system at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Fans were on their feet cheering, hoisting their smart phones to record the moment: the first championship of the Overwatch League. The London Spitfire toppled the underdog Philadelphia Fusion on Saturday afternoon, an important mile-marker for a first-year league that began play in January with designs on revolutionizing the way esports is played, structured and consumed. The confetti, the costumed fans, the raucous atmosphere – it was as much part of the OWL dream as it was the league’s blueprint. Saturday marked the culmination of the inaugural season, and while the upstart league has touted it as a huge success, it was only a step. The looming transition to the local markets will ultimately define the success of not just the league but also whether its ambitious model can truly reshape the esports landscape. “The city-based format has really taken off in a faster and in a bigger way than I had expected,” said Nate Nanzer, the league commissioner, “and, frankly, like I knew it would work — for all the reasons that work in traditional sports. I just thought it would maybe take more time.” The league (OWL) wasn’t built to be a get-rich-quick scheme. It aims to have the staying power and popularity of traditional sports leagues like the NBA or NFL, connecting with communities the way the New York Yankees or New England Patriots do, and producing revenues that blur the line between games and sports. [With Overwatch League Grand Finals, esports takes over Brooklyn to the roar of thunderous applause] “I think it is still a long-term play. One year in a sports league is immaterial,” said Jonathan Kraft, president of the Kraft Group, which owns the OWL’s Boston Uprising franchise and also the New England Patriots. “We did this with an eye towards building long-term asset value.” Long before Saturday’s championship formally brought the inaugural season to a close, OWL officials had been busy plotting out Season 2 and beyond. ESPN reported recently that the league is finalizing agreements with three expansion franchises – one in Atlanta, one in Paris and another in Guangzhou, China – and as many as three more could be on the way, each selling for $30-60 million. And while the league’s most fervent fans are accustomed to following OWL games via the live-streaming video service Twitch, the league also signed a broadcast deal this month that will put future matches on ESPN and Disney channels. While the league’s online numbers exceeded expectations for many team executives – the broadcasts averaged anywhere from 80,000 to 170,000 concurrent viewers — team and league officials feel certain their Year 1 successes are only a preview of what’s to come. They think the league is still rolling down the runway, and though there are some potential obstacles ahead, they feel they’re following a blueprint that will revolutionize esports. “If Overwatch League is successful, it’s inherently changed the model for every publisher, for every league and for every team that exists in the world,” said Noah Whinston, the chief executive of the Los Angeles Valiant franchise. “Having a localized model at this scale has never been attempted before. If this league is successful, I think it throws a lot of conventional wisdom about esports completely off the table.”   350k viewers on @Twitch - you better bet that 400k was easily within reach if this went the distance, maybe even half a million. Still, have to imagine that + ESPN + Disney is a great result.— Ben Goldhaber (@FishStix) July 28, 2018    A global league’s local vision The two squads of players sat on a stage at one end of the arena, dwarfed by the giant video scoreboard overhead. The favored London Spitfire squad consisted of six Korean gamers, all of whom would be carded by any bartender in Brooklyn, and the Philadelphia Fusion featured six players from five different countries. None of the players on the stage was American and none had any tangible connection to the city he’d been representing these past four months. The novelty of OWL is its geolocating model in which the 12 franchises are tied to specific cities, just like traditional sports leagues. It’s a novel formula and based on the early returns, Blizzard, the game’s publisher, could eventually use the same approach with other titles, most notably Call of Duty, a popular esports title for the past dozen years. [ESPN secures Overwatch League broadcast rights, continuing esports’ mainstream surge] But in Year 1 of OWL, all the teams were actually located in the Los Angeles area, playing their matches at the same 450-seat Burbank, Calif., studio that formerly hosted “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.” That will be the Year 2 arrangement too. But owners are hopeful that in Year 3 – 2020 – the teams will relocate to their actual cities, which will open up new revenue streams. A report from the market research company Newzoo earlier this year suggested global esports revenues will top $900 million this year and will nearly double in the next three years. The OWL teams know that money is out there, which is why franchise rights for the initial 12 teams sold for $20 million apiece. “Ultimately, to really be a force — to create the types of monetization that you’d like to have on a local basis, the team has to be in-market more regularly,” Kraft said.    Fans of London Spitfire celebrate the win (David ‘Dee’ Delgado/For The Washington Post)  The league sought out owners who have experience in traditional sports, who understand cultivating an audience in a local market. The OWL owners include the Kraft family, Fred Wilpon, who owns the New York Mets, and Stan Kroenke, who owns the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Rams. But with the squads representing cities in name only, there’s only so much they can do with that knowledge. Teams have hosted watch parties and tried to generate local media interest but opportunities are inherently limited. Estimates suggest as many as 150 million people watch esports globally, a figure that is expected to only grow in coming years. But the league wants a particularly avid following to bloom in the league’s hand-picked cities. They can then leverage that fandom and create revenue streams: ticket sales, merchandising, local sponsorships, community partnerships. “I think monetization is the core issue in esports,” Whinston said. “We all know how big the audience is. … We’re still a long way away from generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue on an annual basis, but I think we’ve made the right steps to start proving out the different pieces to the model.” [Overwatch League’s Grand Finals provide a crucial esports lesson: Adapt or die] Kraft likens the league’s Season 1 core audience to low-hanging fruit, largely gamers who didn’t need much arm-twisting. The challenge down the road will be growing beyond that. “I think to start to attract and educate casual fans and bring the geographic connection in — I think of people who don’t love hockey but say, ‘The Bruins are my team because they live in Boston,’” he said. “I think you have to be in-market to fully take advantage of that.” “Once it comes into the market, those less-than-avid fans then have a reason to start paying attention. That’s when we’ll really have to kick it into high gear,” he continued. “Look, the league launched very successfully, no one can dispute that. … And we’ll just get stronger next year. But the next real big test will be when we go in-market in 2020.”    Cosplayers dressed as their favorite characters in Overwatch for the first-ever finals (David ‘Dee’ Delgado/For The Washington Post)  Can a game become a pastime? Overwatch, barely two years old, already has a loyal following. The fans who flooded Brooklyn – many of whom lined up hours before the Barclay Center doors opened — wore gear representing all 12 of the league’s teams, many featuring the names of specific players across their shoulders. Many others came dressed in costume as the game’s heroes – Sombra, Zarya, Widowmaker and even Wrecking Ball, a new hamster character introduced last month, among them — and seemed to connect with the characters in the game as much as the players using them. In the arena, the players sat mostly still on the stage, their hands doing all the work unseen, their heads shielded from the crowd by monitors. Most of the action took place on the gigantic videoboard overhead. Overwatch is a six-on-six shooter game, a futuristic adventure that is both the reason for the league’s instant success and perhaps a slight cause for trepidation. Even as the league took off this spring, many gamers started gravitating this year to another title. Fortnite became undoubtedly the game of the moment, reportedly topping 125 million players and bringing in $1 million a day. “What Fortnite has done is absolutely incredible,” said Tucker Roberts, president of the Fusion franchise. “It’s pulling fans right now from Overwatch, League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike — all the biggest games that have been around for years. It’s no joke. … But I don’t think that will persist forever.” Fortnite and its battle royale format don’t lend itself to a team-based league, and OWL officials are quick to point out that there are always new titles. Even if some temporarily siphon off players, the good games — think: StarCraft, League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Warcraft – tend to have staying power. [Are pro athletes playing too much Fortnite? Some teams are worried.] “From my perspective, the fears of esports fads and games coming in and out of favor is a little overblown,” said Whinston. “Of course, there are casual fans that will move from game to game, but I think it’s overly simplistic to say, ‘Well, a new game will come along and Overwatch will fall out of popularity.’” The key is evolution. Updates, new maps, new characters, new technology. And unlike traditional sports, esports has the ability to tweak its games at any time, even during a season. Blizzard makes regular Overwatch updates and this year even introduced a new character midway through the season, which forced teams to change strategies and upended the league hierarchy. As a result, the best regular-season team, the New York Excelsior, was ousted in the OWL semifinals. The Fusion, which sneaked into the playoffs with the sixth and final roster spot, instead found itself in Brooklyn this weekend. While baseball or football would never fundamentally alter its rule book midway through the season, OWL officials seemed to embrace a drastic midseason change that forced players to adapt. “I think there’s a lot of traditional sports that are struggling to keep fans engaged and engage with young fans because they haven’t evolved in 100 years,” Nanzer said. “And so I think that’s an advantage that we have over traditional sports.”    The championship trophy for the first Overwatch League finals. (David ‘Dee’ Delgado/For The Washington Post)  Building on the foundation The league said it sold out the approximately 11,000 available seats for the two-day finals. Any fans searching the secondary market for tickets last week were paying at least $125 to get into the arena. DJ Khaled performed before the day’s main event and for the next 75 minutes, all eyes were glued the videoboard. Down below cameras fluttered about, zooming in tight on the players. It was all broadcast live globally on Twitch and scheduled to re-air during prime time on ESPN2. The linear broadcast deal is regarded as a big step for the young league. It not only validated esports’ place on the North American sports landscape, but it has the potential to help broaden OWL’s reach. Team executives know gamers are comfortable turning to Twitch but feel there’s also a potential audience that’s more accustomed to traditional cable. (Twitch is owned by Amazon, whose founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) “Your core fan base might not go there, but their parents and their family and friends may,” said the Fusion’s Roberts, who’s the son of Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts. It could potentially help mainstream the sport in a way where discussion isn’t relegated to online portals, college dorm rooms or school hallways. It could be discussed on sports talk radio, featured on SportsCenter and debated at the office water cooler. Its audience wouldn’t merely be those who play Overwatch themselves.

Think about it this way, nobody would say you need to play baseball in order to be a baseball fan. I believe what we’re building is kind of a social and cultural movement.” The way team and league executives see it, they jumped into a business where the market was already in place with a built-in audience that was hungry for an engaging product. And OWL officials are counting on them being around for awhile. “Have you met a 12-year old recently?” Nanzer asks. “Because if you have, I’m guessing all they do is watch other people play video games on Twitch and YouTube. And that’s not going to magically change when they turn 35. It’s not like they’re going to turn 35 and be like, ‘Well, I’m a baseball fan now.’” They hope the party inside of Barclays Saturday was just a glimpse at the future: fans filling seats, long lines at merchandise stands, a riveting competition taking place on stage. That commitment could only become more common in generations to come. “In the far away future — like 20 years from now — I don’t think there will be any non-gamers,” said Roberts. “I think kids today, they’ll have kids, and they’ll play games with their kids. It’s like who today do you know that doesn’t play any sports? Everyone at least has some familiarity. I think that’s where things are headed.” The Barclays crowd certainly knew what they were watching. They waved signs, cheered on their favorite players and were treated to an exciting finale. London entered the day having won three straight matches, including a 3-1 win on Friday. Led by 18-year old Joon-yeong Park, a damage specialist better known in the Overwatch world as “Profit,” the Spitfire won the Junkertown map, breezed through Lijiang Tower and then sealed the title by battling back and toppling the Fusion on King’s Row, a London-inspired map.

Top-seeded Caroline Wozniacki withdrew from the tournament Tuesday without playing a match because of a leg injury. Stephens, the defending U.S. Open champion, said she was simply outplayed by the 91st-ranked Petkovic, a former top 10 player whose career highlights include a run to the semifinals in the 2014 French Open and six WTA Tour titles. She advances to face either No. 6 seed Belinda Bencic or Nao Hibino of Japan in the third round. “I could have obviously played better, but she played a good match and today unfortunately just wasn’t my day,” said Stephens, who is ranked No. 3 in the world. “I didn’t serve great, but that’s not what cost me the match.” Stephens won the Citi Open in 2015 for her first WTA title and enjoys plenty of crowd support in Washington. She heads to tournaments in Montreal and then Cincinnati before beginning her title defense at the U.S. Open later this month. “I enjoy being on hard court, so hopefully some things will connect in the next few weeks leading into the U.S. Open … just focus on playing my game, executing better, just getting some more matches.” Petkovic arrived in Washington at least a full week before the tournament began to acclimate to the humidity. She said her extra preparation played a factor Wednesday as she was able to tally her first win over a top 10 player this year. “It is definitely a confidence boost, I guess,” Petkovic said. “I’ve been in the top 10 before.

We couldn’t look ourselves in the mirror knowing that we had simply thrown in the towel on a team full of talent and heart.” [Mike Rizzo delivers a message for Nationals: ‘If you’re not in, you’re in the way’] Speculation over whether the Nationals would buy, sell or complete some combination swirled until Tuesday, with Bryce Harper at the center. Washington had multiple trades for multiple players, including Harper, in place Monday night but ownership backed out, according to people with knowledge of the situation. The club then informed Harper, whose name was circulating in rumors, that he wasn’t getting moved. “I think whenever you hear your name or see your name on stuff you always wonder,” Harper, a free agent this winter, said Tuesday. “But I think that’s just the business end of the game, it’s part of the game and other teams are trying to get better and it’s just something that came up. [I’m] glad I’m still inside this clubhouse.” [Bryce Harper on Nationals considering trades: ‘Glad I’m still inside this clubhouse’] The only trade the Nationals made Tuesday was sending reliever Brandon Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs for a low-level minor leaguer — and on-field performance wasn’t the main motivation behind the move. Otherwise, the Nationals stood pat. They’ve gone 2-0 since then, beating the flailing New York Mets to a pulp, but even that didn’t come without Shawn Kelley spiking his glove in frustration after giving up a three-run home run in the ninth inning of a 25-4 win Tuesday. Rizzo decided the act was worth designating Kelley for assignment. [Svrluga: Mike Rizzo had to shore up the Nationals’ clubhouse, because Dave Martinez couldn’t] Kelley’s departure wasn’t part of the deadline calculus, but the Nationals are moving on without him.

Senior Ivan Bender and sophomore Joshua Tomaic are now Turgeon’s two main frontcourt options off the bench, and Maryland is using 10 of its 13 allotted scholarships. The Terrapins on Wednesday announced their nonconference schedule, which starts with their season opener against Delaware in College Park on Nov. 6. The nonconference schedule includes a matchup with surprise 2018 national semifinalist Loyola Chicago on Dec. 8 at Baltimore’s Royal Farms Arena, a home date with Virginia as part of the Big Ten-ACC Challenge on Nov. 28 and a visit from Seton Hall on Dec. 22.

Kudla, an Arlington native and the 85th-ranked singles player in the world, had never won a match at his hometown tournament despite six years of competing at Rock Creek Park Tennis Center. As he faced Slovakia’s Lukas Lacko on Tuesday, he drew inspiration from another Washington sports team that defied history to win big this year. “I was like, ‘You know what, if the Caps can do it, the D.C. turn can happen,’” Kudla said. Kudla lost the set in a tiebreak, but won the next two with ease to advance to the second round of the Citi Open for the first. On Wednesday, he won again, taking down No. 12 seed Karen Khachanov, 6-2, 6-3, and building on what has been an excellent summer. Kudla made his second career ATP semifinal in June at a grass-court tournament in Germany where he lost a close match to Roger Federer. In the past year, he’s shot up 90 spots in the rankings. Next in Washington, the 25-year-old awaits either sixth-seeded Lucas Pouille or Vincent Millot in the third round of the singles’ draw. He is also competing in the men’s doubles draw with his old friend Frances Tiafoe, the 13th seed, who rolled through Hubert Hurkacz on Wednesday afternoon to notch his first-ever win at the Citi Open as well. [French tennis player Benoit Paire threw a tantrum for the ages at the Citi Open] Kudla attributes the locals’ success to something in the water in Washington. Or better yet, something in the ice. “Before, it was maybe a curse over the whole city, any athlete here just can’t win anything important,” Kudla said after his match Monday. “But things are changing. As athletes, you find inspiration in other athletes in other sports. I’ve definitely found inspirations in the Caps.” Kudla has yet to make it through an interview at the Citi Open without being asked about his Caps fandom; he’s a veritable die-hard. He was playing a tournament in England for most of the Stanley Cup finals and considered flying home to catch a game. Instead, he watched games into wee hours of the morning, staying up until 5 a.m. in England to watch the Cup-clinching Game 5 despite that he had a quarterfinal match to play that same day. He lost, to Jeremy Chardy in three sets, and had no regrets. “Another challenger, another tournament? It’ll always be there,” Kudla said. “But the Stanley Cup? It may never happen again, you never know.” The Arlington native, who was born in Ukraine, is feeling confident not just because his team won the Stanley Cup. Kudla also has rediscovered his passion for tennis after debating quitting the sport a year ago. He was ranked 175th this time last year, a steep nosedive for someone who had reached the top 100 as a 20-year-old. He took three weeks off before last year’s U.S. Open to reevaluate, then began working with coach Dustin Taylor during the offseason. Taylor simplified Kudla’s career plan, advising him to focus on fitness and doing the basics well. Kudla made it through qualifying and into the main draw of the Australian Open in January for the first time in five Grand Slams. Making it to the semifinals in Germany and winning his first match at the Citi Open has renewed his energy. “First match in DC has always been something that’s lingering over me, now to have that gone and over with, even yesterday I said I knew I could play well today,” Kudla said Wednesday. “Now that I’m relaxed, good things can happen.” Tiafoe echoed the sentiment Wednesday. The two grew up playing tennis together in College Park and have fed off of each other’s success for years. As Kudla’s game has soared, Tiafoe has also reached new heights. The 20-year-old reached the third round of Wimbledon for the first time last month and is currently ranked a career-high No. 41 in the world. Tiafoe dominated his match Wednesday and will meet either No. 3 seed David Goffin or Pierre-Hughes Hubert in the third round. He and Kudla were scheduled to play doubles Wednesday as well but received a win by walkover after Nick Kyrgios, seeded fifth in the singles draw and also playing doubles, withdrew from the Citi Open because of a hip injury. The ATP announced Kyrgios’ withdrawal just minutes before his noon singles match was scheduled to begin. This is the mercurial Aussie’s second false start at the Citi Open: Last year he retired in the second set of his match against Tennys Sandgren, that time for pain in his right shoulder. “It’s the same left hip injury I got after a sudden movement in Atlanta last week, and I haven’t had enough time to be ready to play this week,” Kyrgios said in a statement. “The physio recommended a couple of days of rest, rehab and treatment. I’ve got ample time for it to settle down before Toronto. “It’s disappointing. I’m sure I’ll be here again with another chance to play, but at this stage I can’t risk aggravating the injury with Masters 1000s and the U.S. Open coming up. Last year I wasn’t healthy at the U.S. Open, so I want to be right for that.” The withdrawal sent Kudla and Tiafoe straight into the quarterfinals of the men’s doubles draw, where they will meet Ivan Dodig and Ben McLachlan, and granted them a free Wednesday afternoon. Their schedule for the rest of the day was straightforward. “Relax, recover, try to keep the D.C. hopes alive,” Kudla said. “The Caps have shown that crazy things can happen, and that’s the beauty of sports. The unpredictable can happen, there’s always an underdog story.” ', '‘Keep the D.C. hopes alive’: Locals Denis Kudla, Frances Tiafoe roll in Citi Open - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/08/01/i-said-what-i-said-cowboys-dak-prescott-has-no-regrets-about-his-national-anthem-comments/': ('Dak Prescott is trying to clarify his stance on national anthem demonstrations. (Gus Ruelas/Associated Press)   by Cindy Boren August 1 at 1:39 PM Email the author   Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott has gotten an earful since he told reporters last week that he doesn’t think a football game “is the time or the venue” for demonstrations and protests during the national anthem, a stance that was more closely aligned with owner Jerry Jones than with many of his co-workers. Prescott is trying his best to set the record straight, saying this week that he wasn’t oblivious to the criticism, and trying to explain what sets him apart from Jones, whose my-way-or-the-highway position reportedly led the NFL to stifle him as it tries to work out a viable anthem policy with the NFL Players Association. “You get on social media you see it. It doesn’t bother me,” Prescott told Clarence E. Hill Jr. of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “I said what I said. You have an opinion. Everyone else has an opinion. They are entitled to it as well. I accepted what they said and respect it. They should respect mine.” Prescott’s opinion from last week? “I never protest during the anthem, and I don’t think that’s the time or the venue to do so,” he said. “The game of football has always brought me such peace, and I think it does the same for a lot of people — a lot of people playing the game, a lot of people watching the game, a lot of people who have any impact of the game — so when you bring such controversy to the stadium, to the field, to the game, it takes away. It takes away from that, it takes away from the joy and the love that football brings a lot of people. “For me, I’m all about making a change and making a difference, and I think this whole kneeling and all of that was just about raising awareness and the fact that we’re still talking about social injustice years later, I think we’ve gotten to that point. I think we’ve proved, we know the social injustice. I’m up for taking the next step whatever the next step may be for action and not just kneeling. I’ve always believed standing up for what I believe in, and that’s what I’m going to continue to do.” Not everyone heard all of that, though. [Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen rips Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for his anthem stance and for not following it himself] The Raiders’ Tahir Whitehead tweeted that “it looks like Dak don’t [sic] want to lose that Campbell’s Chunky Soup deal!” The Undefeated defended him by using the headline: “Dak Prescott isn’t a race traitor because he thinks there’s a better way to protest.” Prescott became the subject of endless debate on sports networks and radio stations. And Twitter was on fire over the matter. “I think there was a little misunderstanding of the fact of what I believe in,” Prescott told Hill. “I never said I didn’t believe in social injustice and things that were going on. I just said I didn’t think that the national anthem was the time. It’s two minutes out of our day that we could also be spending embracing what our country should be and what our country is going to be one day that we know that it’s not right now. That is the sad part about it — that it’s not. “I respect everybody. And power to the people that kneel. That is what they believe in and they should be able to kneel. For me, the game of football has been such a peace. It’s a moment for me to be at peace and think about all the great things our country does have even though we know it’s not a good for us right now.” As he said, he prefers community involvement to symbolism. “I am for the action,” Prescott said. “I am for joining [the Philadelphia Eagles’] Malcolm [Jenkins] and joining those guys in doing something different. That is what I mean my taking that next step rather than just kneeling or standing. I don’t think kneeling or standing is creating a solution for us.” Jones helped resurrect the national anthem debate last week, saying that “our policy [for players] is you stand for the anthem, toe on the line.”\\xa0Stephen Jones, the Cowboys’ executive vice president, took his father’s position to another level, saying players should stand on the sideline “if they want to be a Dallas Cowboy.”\\xa0Although Jerry Jones later added that Trump’s “interest in what we’re doing is problematic,” the president\\xa0offered his support\\xa0for Jones, one of the NFL owners taking a hard line on the issue, in a tweet: “Way to go Jerry.

(Alex Brandon/Associated Press)   by Chelsea Janes August 1 at 7:02 PM Email the author   The message is clear now, delivered first by the trade of Brandon Kintzler on Tuesday, then emphatically when the Washington Nationals designated Shawn Kelley for assignment early Wednesday morning. “If you’re not in, you’re in the way,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said hours after the latter move, acknowledging that the reason he sent both men packing was his feeling that they were undermining clubhouse culture. [Mike Rizzo had to shore up the Nationals’ clubhouse, because Dave Martinez couldn’t] The Nationals had weighed their options at Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline following a disappointing start to the season. They considered selling more expensive veterans such as Kelley, and had multiple trades involving multiple players, including Bryce Harper, in place Monday night before ownership backed out, according to people with knowledge of the situation. Rizzo said he and the front office decided they had to give this roster a chance to turn things around. Nationals principal owner Mark Lerner wrote a public letter Wednesday acknowledging the team’s struggles while solidifying ownership’s position. “In spite of a player payroll that exceeds $200 million — the second highest in baseball — and exceeding the luxury tax threshold, so far this season has not lived up to everyone’s expectations,” Lerner wrote. “The trade deadline forced us to take a hard look at the roster and contemplate whether to keep the team we have for the remainder of the season or make significant changes. “At the end of the day, my family and Mike Rizzo decided that we just couldn’t give up on this team We couldn’t look ourselves in the mirror knowing that we had simply thrown in the towel on a team full of talent and heart.” [Nationals owner Mark Lerner pens letter to fans: ‘We just couldn’t give up on this team’] Going forward — and changing the clubhouse culture — came down to the two decisions the Nationals did make this week. Kelley threw his glove and glared into the dugout after allowing a home run to Austin Jackson in what had been a 25-1 game Tuesday night. He said afterward that he was frustrated with umpires missing calls and prodding him on his pace. Manager Dave Martinez, protecting his player, said he believed that’s all it was. Rizzo said he saw what many who noticed Kelley’s glare inferred. Kelley was frustrated to be pitching in a game such as that one in the first place, and he showed up his manager. His agent, Mike McCann, later told ESPN Kelley was hoping Martinez would argue on his behalf. Rizzo thought differently. “I [interpreted as Kelley frustrated to be in the game]. It may not have been, but that’s the way I looked at it,” Rizzo said before the Nationals’ 5-3 win Wednesday over the Mets.\\xa0 “After what happened before the game [Tuesday], getting ready for post-deadline season, I thought it was truly a day we should have been happy and celebrating — we had a big win against a division rival and felt good about ourselves — and such a selfish act is not what we’re here for.” The Nationals signed Kelley to a three-year, $15 million dollar deal before the 2016 season. In his 2 1/2 years with them, he grew into a beloved clubhouse presence, a jovial guy who made newcomers feel comfortable. After Kelley’s outburst Tuesday night, Max Scherzer and Ryan Madson spoke with Kelley in hushed tones, the kind of conversation they do not usually have with veteran teammates after bad performances. Obviously they noticed his reaction. Everyone did, and Rizzo believed he had to move. In the wake of the renewed commitment to this season, from the top down, Rizzo said he could not allow anyone to undermine the state of his clubhouse. “It’s pretty cut and dry. You guys all saw it. The act that he portrayed on the field last night was disrespectful to the name on the front of the jersey, the organization, specifically Davey Martinez,” Rizzo said. “And you’re either in or you’re in the way. And I thought he was in the way.” Kelley had bounced back from a brutal 2017 season and was pitching to a 3.34 ERA in 35 appearances. A person familiar with the Nationals’ plans said they listened to offers for the free agent-to-be before Tuesday’s deadline and they could still get something for him now that he has been designated for assignment. He is the second well-liked veteran to go in the last 24 hours, as Rizzo dealt Kintzler to the Chicago Cubs just before the deadline. People familiar with the situation said Rizzo confronted Kintzler about being the anonymous source for various reports that painted an unflattering picture of the Nationals’ clubhouse culture. Kintzler denied being that source in an interview on 106.7 the Fan on Wednesday. “I’ve never talked to that [author] Jeff Passan guy in my life, so that’s an interesting accusation,” Kintzler said on the show “Grant & Danny.” “I know for a fact that someone got him to admit his source was not a player, so it wasn’t me. I’ve never talked to that guy in my life.” Rizzo didn’t explicitly acknowledge that clubhouse culture was the reasoning behind the Kintzler deal but did not reject the premise when asked whether his decisions on Kintzler and Kelley represented a shift in mentality about players who undermine their manager. “We’ve always had that stance. We’ve always had a stance that if you’re not with us, you’re against us, and you’re in the way,” Rizzo said. “The culture here has been so good for so long. We’ve had so much success over the last seven years that we’re not going to let anybody interfere with that success .\\u2009.\\u2009. We’re not going to let any one person derail what we’re going to do.” Martinez seemed to struggle with the move, eyes welling for the second time in two days when he spoke about having to designate Kelley, whom he said he “respected” and “is not a bad person.” The Nationals will have to absorb the remaining portion of Kelley’s salary, unless another team picks him up on waivers, which seems unlikely. That, in itself, should demonstrate the frustration the front office felt at his outburst and the optics it created for a team already answering questions about its clubhouse culture. Without him, the Nationals have lost two of their most outspoken veterans in the bullpen, leaving Madson, injured Sean Doolittle and newcomer Kelvin Herrera as the longest-tenured members of that corps. “Those are two guys within our bullpen, two of our more vocal guys. They were vocal leaders, and they led that way,” Doolittle said. “Now it’s going to fall on somebody to kind of step up and assume that role.” The Nationals recalled right-hander Jimmy Cordero to replace Kelley on the roster. The 26-year-old is pitching to a 1.88 ERA in 38 games for Syracuse this season and has struck out more than a batter per inning. In Cordero and Wander Suero, the Nationals get two durable, versatile relievers who can provide them multiple innings. Kintzler and Kelley, as more veteran players with injury histories, limited Martinez’s options more. But jettisoning Kelley was not about on-field performance. Rizzo left no doubt about that.

Cabrera can play at second base, third base and shortstop.

Ramos also gives the Phillies another catcher who can frame pitches. With\\xa0Knapp behind the plate, Philadelphia’s pitchers get a called strike on pitches out of the zone 5.4 percent of the time, per TrueMedia; Ramos has a 7.2 percent called-strike rate on those pitches, just slightly lower than Alfaro (7.8 percent).

Soria joins a bullpen that\\xa0combined for the\\xa0third-most wins above replacement in the majors this season (5.5), behind only the New York Yankees (6.9 fWAR) and San Diego Padres (5.7 fWAR).

Look for that change-up to be a potent weapon for\\xa0Milwaukee:\\xa0Soria has fanned 18 of 44 batters on that pitch with a mere .167 average against this season.     Schoop, an all-star second baseman last season with the Baltimore Orioles, allows Travis Shaw to move back to his natural position at third base.\\xa0Schoop will also give\\xa0Milwaukee a big bat: He has 17 home runs through 89 games in 2018 with pull power that should play nicely at Miller Park, a stadium that sees right-handed hitters hit seven percent more home runs per Baseball Prospectus (107 park factor). Camden Yards, by comparison, had a park factor of 110 for right-handed home run hitters.    (TruMedia)  Arizona Diamondbacks Playoff chances went from 50 to 53 percent Arizona’s starting rotation is one of the best in the majors (9.6 fWAR, tied for seventh) and newly acquired\\xa0Jake Diekman and Brad Ziegler will bolster a bullpen that ranks 24th (1.2 fWAR). Ziegler\\xa0is 1-5 this season with 10 saves and a 3.98 ERA with just three earned runs in 29 innings (0.93 ERA) since June. Diekman, a left-handed reliever, is striking out 27 percent of batters in 2018 with two pitches, a sinker and slider.    (TruMdeia)  The slider is used more often against right-handed batters, who manage just a .191 average and .550 OPS against the pitch this season. The sinker is effective against batters on both sides of the plate (.222 against with a .654 OPS).

[With two games left, DeAngelo Hall uncertain what future holds with Redskins, NFL] Hall appeared in five games during the 2017 season for the Redskins, making only two starts. But as his former teammates are inching closer to Week 1 of the 2018 season, Hall insists he’s “great” and at peace with his decision. “Yeah, yeah, I feel good,” Hall said Wednesday morning before heading out to join his former teammates on the field. “I mean, didn’t like the way last year ended. Obviously, I would have liked to have been prepared to play and things like that. But things happen for a reason. My goal last year was to not have a surgery; to be a great teammate, the best teammate I could be; a good leader and not have a surgery, and I accomplished that. So it just felt right. “I tell people all the time, as a leader in the last couple years, I was always trying to groom the next crop of guys to take my spot, and when I finally felt like they were ready, or it showed they were ready, it was time for me to go.” Hall spoke glowingly about fourth-year cornerback Quinton Dunbar, who signed a three-year extension earlier this offseason. “He’s amazing. Amazing,” he said of Dunbar, who is aiming to solidify his position as the starting cornerback opposite veteran Josh Norman. “He’s been playing lights-out football. Look at the way he’s transformed his body a little bit and his mentality. He’s done what I would have expected him to do, so I’m not surprised. So I’m proud to say I had a hand in helping him become the person he is, the player he is. Because he’s going to be hell now. He’s going to be hell.” And the change in Dunbar isn’t just physical, according to Hall. “It’s all of it, it’s the combination, it’s the mentality,” he added. “He’s learned over these years how to be a corner, he’s learned how not to only be a corner but a football player. I always talk about football players. I don’t care about a great corner or a great receiver, I want a great football player. I think he’s shown his maturity and he’s able to be a great football player.” More Redskins coverage: Redskins RB Chris Thompson getting his ‘groove’ back as he nears full health Derrius Guice says Redskins running backs are enjoying themselves amid competition As new helmet rule creates confusion around NFL, Redskins unsure how it will be enforced ', 'Former Redskins safety DeAngelo Hall swears — literally — that he is now retired - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/08/01/a-10-year-old-nicknamed-superman-broke-a-really-old-michael-phelps-record/': ('window.havePowaBoot=true;  by Matt Bonesteel August 1 at 11:18 AM Email the author   If your name is Clark Kent Apuada, there’s really only one nickname that could work, and on Sunday, the 10-year-old who goes by “Superman” took down a record that had been set by 23-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps way back in 1995. Swimming at the\\xa0Far Western Long Course Championships in Moraga, Calif., Apuada finished the 100-meter butterfly in 1:09.38, besting Phelps’s 23-year-old, 10-and-under meet record of\\xa01:10.48 by more than a second. “That was one of my dreams — to beat Michael Phelps’s record — since I was 7,” Apuado said in the above video. In 1996, Phelps set the overall U.S. 10-and-under record for the 100 butterfly at\\xa01:08.54, a mark that since has been bested by Carson Foster in 2012 (1:07.24) and then Andrew Rogers, who broke the record twice at a 2015 meet in Texas. Rogers’s 1:05.98 still stands as the 10-and-under U.S. record in the 100 butterfly. Apuada, a rising fifth-grader who has been swimming competitively for four years, ended up with gold medals in every event he swam in at the meet, winning the 200 individual medley, 50 butterfly, 50 backstroke, 100 backstroke, 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle to go along with his 100 butterfly crown. As for his nickname, Apuada’s mother Cynthia told the Huffington Post that she always liked the name Clark and that her husband’s favorite superhero was Superman, and everything just flowed naturally from there. “We’re always just telling people his name is Clark. But when they realize his full name, people just call him Superman,” Cynthia Apuada said. Not to get too far into the (nerdy) weeds here, but Arthur Curry Apuada perhaps would have been a more apt name.

For the first time, Williams managed to win only one game in a professional match, holding serve in the first set and then being bulldozed by Johanna Konta, 6-1, 6-0, on Tuesday night in the first round of the Silicon Valley Classic in San Jose. Williams’s loss eclipsed a 6-0, 6-2 drubbing she suffered at the hands of Simona Halep in the 2014 WTA finals in Singapore. Konta is 48th in the world, according to the WTA rankings. “I know I can play a zillion times better, so that kind of helps out, too. I have so many things on my mind I don’t have time to be shocked about a loss that clearly wasn’t at my best right now,” Williams said, via the Associated Press. “When I was out there, [I] was fighting. That’s the only thing I can say. I wasn’t just like giving it away, and I was moving a lot better. So I’m just trying to take the positives out of it.” Despite a run to the final at Wimbledon, Williams — 26th in the WTA rankings — has struggled at times during her return to competitive tennis to reach her typical level of play. She gave birth to her first child by Caesarean section last September and subsequently dealt with a litany of health issues, including\\xa0a pulmonary embolism. “It’s difficult, I guess,” she said Tuesday, speaking of her inability to regain her consistency and dominance. She then amended that comment: “Not, ‘I guess.’ For sure.” Despite her 6-3, 6-3 loss to Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon final, Williams appeared to gain some confidence in her game during that tournament, saying before the final,\\xa0“This is not inevitable for me” after a 13-month absence from the tour. Williams, who has worn compression shorts under her dress because of her history of blood clots, tearfully said after that loss that her mind-set had changed and that she was now playing for “all the moms out there.” What will the U.S. Open, the last Grand Slam event of the year, bring? “I didn’t know a couple of months ago where I was, where I would be, how I would do, how I would be able to come back,” she said after the Wimbledon loss, which came a little over a month after she withdrew from the French Open with a pectoral injury. “It was such a long way to see light at the end of the road, kind of. So I think these two weeks have really showed me that, okay, I can compete.” Read more from The Post: Rays going with unorthodox zero-starting-pitcher rotation Johnny Manziel says he feels ‘very blessed’ to get his first CFL start Friday night Athletes can easily trick popular concussion test, study finds ‘Our worst nightmare’: ESPN’s Samantha Ponder describes her newborn’s emergency surgery Bode Miller and his wife talk about their daughter’s drowning: ‘It happens in the blink of an eye’ Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen rips Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for his anthem stance — and for not following it himself LeBron James: Trump has used sports ‘to divide us’ ', 'In 52 minutes, Serena Williams suffered the most lopsided loss of her career - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/nationals-journal/wp/2018/07/31/nationals-shawn-kelley-says-he-acted-like-a-baby-during-his-ninth-inning-outburst/': ('Shawn Kelley (Mark Brown/Getty Images)   by Chelsea Janes August 1 at 10:41 AM Email the author   The Nationals designated Shawn Kelley for assignment Wednesday morning, hours after the reliever’s ninth-inning outburst in a blowout win over the New York Mets.

Asked to pitch the ninth inning with the Nats leading 25-1, the veteran allowed three runs on four hits, one of which was a two-run homer by Austin Jackson. After that pitch, Kelley slammed his glove to the ground and glared into the dugout. Even amateur interpreters might surmise that Kelley was not pleased to be pitching in that situation at all. “No, you can ask everybody in the bullpen. When [Wander] Suero’s pitch count got up, I said, ‘I’ve probably got the ninth.’ I figured I was the freshest reliever and I was going to throw the ninth,” Kelley said Tuesday night, adding that his frustration was due to disagreements with the umpires who were prodding him on his pace. “Like I said, for me, I’m not justifying it. I should not have thrown my glove and acted like a baby out there. But at the same time, I’m acting like it’s one to one for me. I’m giving it everything I’ve got.” [After a stress-packed deadline day, Nats hammer Mets in a laugher] Kelley recorded the final three outs, nonetheless, and the Nationals won, 25-4. Earlier in the day, the Nationals traded Brandon Kintzler to the Cubs. Mike Rizzo and Dave Martinez said one reason they felt they could make the deal was the emergence of Suero, who can pitch multiple innings and has proved himself resilient when handed heavy workloads. But when Suero’s pitch count climbed to 29, Martinez called on Kelley for the ninth inning. Just before the home run he allowed to Jackson, Kelley got into a heated conversation with second base umpire Tripp Gibson III. He had also had a back and forth with home plate umpire Adrian Johnson. He said he felt like calls pitchers were getting earlier in the game were not going his way. “[Johnson] told me to slow down. I was a) just trying to keep it going, and b) I’ve used the quick pitch sometimes. He told me to slow down one time, and the other guy behind me [at second base] told me I had to come set or it’s a balk,” Kelley said. “… Then the home plate umpire was telling me to hurry up. I was like, ‘But you told me to slow down.’ It was kind of frustrating. That’s all that was about.” [Svrluga: Nats hang on to Bryce Harper at deadline as Mike Rizzo bets on horses he rode in on] That glare into the dugout, however, casts unavoidable doubt about the true source of that frustration. Kelley’s teammates seemed to think so, too. After the game, Ryan Madson and Max Scherzer approached Kelley for a hushed conversation that did not get heated and ended with pats on the back. But conversations like those do not generally happen after a player shows frustration in a normal bad outing. Martinez said Tuesday that he thought Kelley was just frustrated with the umpires. “I think the homer, and the whole thing with trying to pitch fast and the umpire telling him to stop,” Martinez said. “He was arguing. I gather that’s what it was.” But whatever the reality of the situation, the incident raised questions on a day that initially looked like it would bolster the notion of team solidarity, not undermine it.

(John Locher/Associated Press)   by Tim Bontemps August 1 at 7:00 AM Email the author   Much has been made of the course the Houston Rockets have plotted this summer. Coming off a season in which the Rockets lead the NBA with 65 victories and pushed the Golden State Warriors to seven games in the Western Conference finals, Houston was expected to bring back largely the same team for another shot at the now two-time defending champions. Things haven’t quite gone that way. Yes, Chris Paul and Clint Capela were re-signed, as Houston locked up its top two free agents to long-term deals. But Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute — both key cogs to Houston’s success last season — left in free agency, signing with the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Clippers, respectively. The players Houston signed to replace them — Michael Carter-Williams, James Ennis and, once he clears waivers Wednesday afternoon, Carmelo Anthony — feel like either awkward fits for how the Rockets play, or simply not the same caliber of talent as Ariza and Mbah a Moute. That Carter-Williams, Ennis and Anthony together have a salary cap hit of about $4.5 million — compared to the $15 million Ariza got from Phoenix and the $4.3 million Mbah a Moute received from Los Angeles — makes it hard to ignore the likelihood they weren’t retained because of luxury tax concerns alone. But when the question of whether Houston has taken a step back was posed to James Harden, the NBA’s reigning most valuable player, he didn’t hesitate: Absolutely not. “No. You can go back to articles and conversations and people said, ‘Me and Chris can’t play together.’ [Then] we were the number one [team] in the NBA,” Harden said with a laugh after Team USA practice last week. “Obviously, you can look at a roster and look at different players and say that. But you have to be on that court and you’ve got to be in the trenches and be in the war. “Eventually we will figure it out. We have enough leadership in that locker room and a great coaching staff to figure that out.” Whether the Rockets have taken a step back or not, it is obvious that if Houston is going to come anywhere near replicating the success it had last year, it’s going to have to do so in a different way. From the first day of training camp last season, the Rockets built their team around a switching defense that emphasized its ability to have anyone on the court guard anyone else at any time. It was a defense specifically wired to try to stop the Warriors — and, if Paul hadn’t blown out his hamstring in the final minute of Game 5 of the Western Conference finals, or if the Rockets hadn’t missed 27 straight three-pointers in Game 7, it might have accomplished its goal. But even if one could argue Ariza, now 33, has lost a step, or that Mbah a Moute could be a risk moving forward after dislocating his shoulder twice last season, replacing them won’t be easy. Ennis is the kind of piece of raw clay that Rockets Coach Mike D’Antoni has molded into an impact player in the past, but he’s never come close to providing the kind of impact at either end as Ariza and Mbah a Moute have. Anthony, on the other hand, is coming off a season with the Oklahoma City Thunder in which he struggled to be a third option behind Russell Westbrook and Paul George — precisely the kind of role he will be playing in Houston. And, for all of his offensive gifts, Anthony has never been known as a defensive stopper. There is a method to Houston’s madness, though — at least in the eyes of Eric Gordon, the other Rocket who was part of Team USA’s mini camp last week. It all goes back to that Game 7, and specifically Houston’s inability to make anything from deep over the final three quarters of that game. If Houston had more of an offensive spark, things could have been a lot different. “I still think we’re going to be a championship-caliber team, for sure,” Gordon said. “We did lose two dynamic guys that are really good defenders for us [Ariza and Mbah a Moute], really versatile guys. [But we] brought in guys that are also versatile, but more on the offensive side. “We’re still going to be really good. When you look at that Warriors series, we just needed a little bit more scoring a little bit. We just hit a couple more threes, it would’ve been different even with guys injured. So we’re still in good position.” The counterpoint to that is when Houston did try to deploy an offensive-first player in that Game 7 by playing Ryan Anderson in the third quarter, the Warriors promptly attacked him repeatedly, went on a quick 14-2 run and swung the game decisively in their favor. Still, the Rockets deserve the benefit of the doubt after the season they had. The same goes for General Manager Daryl Morey, who always seems to have a trick up his sleeve. One thing Houston won’t be lacking in, however, is motivation. After the way the West finals played out — with the Rockets, even without Paul, leading at halftime of both Games 6 and 7, before dropping both games — Harden said he hasn’t been able to let it go. “That was a good feeling,” Harden said of winning the league’s MVP award, “but that feeling that I had in that Western Conference finals, with basically one half to go … I need that feeling back. I’ll try to work my butt off, and mentally lock in as much as I can to get back to that feeling. “Like, you are right there. You’re a half away, and then something, just a roadblock hits you and you have to find a way to get past that roadblock. We couldn’t get past that roadblock. It was just too tough. “We’ve got to get back there.” For the next nine months or so, the focus will be on whether the moves the Rockets made this summer will allow them to — or whether Houston let its best chance at a title slip away this past season, done in by Paul’s balky hamstring and all those wayward three-pointers. Just don’t expect Harden to agree with that assessment. “What we have right now is for sure good enough,” he said. “We have to realize nothing changes for us. You’ve got to realize: that was me and Chris’s first year together. Guys were asking, ‘Can they play together? How is that going to work?’ We made it work, and it was easy. “Once training camp hits, we’ll work our butts off, and every single day we’ll just continue to get better and keep chopping away.” Read more: LeBron James: Trump has used sports ‘to divide us’ After procedures on knee and elbow, Paul George is ‘comfortable’ and looking like his old self Jerry Colangelo, one of the NBA’s elder statesmen, talks Team USA, the 76ers and more Rockets become the center of attention on final day of Team USA minicamp The contentious relationship between Kevin Durant and NBA Twitter continues Ted Leonsis projects Wizards as possibly the ‘deepest team that we’ve ever had’ ', 'James Harden laughs off talk that Rockets took a step back this summer - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/08/01/rays-going-with-unorthodox-zero-starting-pitcher-rotation/': (\"Ryne Stanek isn’t a starting pitcher, but he plays one in real life sometimes.

But Faria and then Snell were sent to the disabled list and then Archer was dealt to the Pirates, leaving Tampa Bay with zero starters, at least temporarily.

Except for the reliever who tossed his glove to the ground and glared into the dugout in the ninth inning of a 20-run game. And the reliever who was traded because, according to people with knowledge of the team’s thinking, he had been too critical of the club’s inner workings and clubhouse culture. And the starter and the closer who are still on the disabled list. And here’s the manager’s assessment: “I had a couple [players] pop their heads in today already and say, ‘We’re in,’\\u2009” Dave Martinez said. “We’re good. Everything’s good.” Really? The Nationals are in the section of the season that will determine whether they will establish relevance or fade into oblivion, and not everything is good. Yes, they beat the comically bad New York Mets, 5-3, Wednesday afternoon, and they’re back above .500 — at least for the moment. If the remaining 50-something games were against the Mets, well, then, yeah, maybe everything’s good. The reality, though, is this: These Nationals are fragile, and the man in the lead chair at the moment is made of porcelain. Martinez has not alienated the clubhouse — this is not a Matt Williams-in-2015 moment, not at all — and he has significant pockets of support, both in the dugout and the front office. [Another day, another drama, and the Nationals hold off Mets, 5-3] But for all the games Martinez played — 1,918 in the majors, over 16 seasons — and the decade he spent as a big league coach, he has never occupied his current seat, and it shows. With their season set to either take off or implode, the Nationals are in a position in which they must protect their rookie skipper, rather than be led by him. “You ask every manager that’s been in here: I’m in support of the manager at all times,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said Wednesday. “He’s the leader. He’s the leader in that clubhouse. I think Davey’s leading in a terrific manner.” Except here’s the thing: The Nationals’ roster histrionics both before and after the trade deadline had to do with shoring up clubhouse support around that leader at least in part because Martinez couldn’t shore it up on his own. First came Tuesday’s trade of reliever Brandon Kintzler, which had its genesis in the belief Kintzler was too free with clubhouse information and criticism, according to people with firsthand knowledge of the situation. In various pockets of the clubhouse, that move was met with frustration, indifference and satisfaction. More to the point, though, was the mess at the end of a mess Tuesday night. The Nats held a lead over the Mets of — get this — 25-1. Shawn Kelley’s job, in that moment, is to get three outs. It is not to become obsessed with the umpiring crew, which was messing with Kelley’s pace of play. Kelley gave up a three-run home run. With the Nationals up by 21 runs, he threw his glove to the ground. More important: He glared into the dugout. Did the Nats think he was showing up the manager? “I did,” Rizzo said. “For me, no,” Martinez said. [Mike Rizzo delivers a message for Nationals: ‘If you’re not in, you’re in the way’] The GM chose a side, and chose hard. The manager equivocated, because he does not want to upset the apple cart — even if the apple about which he was worried already had been jettisoned. Rizzo clearly felt the need to step in. He and Martinez and other Nats coaches and executives talked about Kelley long into the night after the blowout Tuesday. They decided to blast Kelley to the moon. “It was pretty cut-and-dried,” Rizzo said. “I thought that the act that he portrayed on the field last night was [a] disrespect to the name on the front of the jersey, the organization — specifically, Davey Martinez.” They told Kelley: You’re cut. Martinez said, “It stinks,” and he got just two hours of sleep. Rizzo neither tossed nor turned. There’s no problem with an organization jettisoning employees because they publicly embarrass leadership. But the point here is that the Nationals either couldn’t or didn’t shore up either of these issues internally. Kintzler and Kelley might not have been the most prominent pieces in a bullpen that must produce if the Nats are to climb back into the National League East race. But that bullpen is without injured closer Sean Doolittle, and that puts more strain on all the other parts; Ryan Madson and Kelvin Herrera each gave up solo homers Wednesday. Both Kintzler and Kelley were useful, and they’re essentially not here for the same reason: In the estimation of some Nats decision-makers, they either publicly or privately brought the manager’s leadership into question. And so, in the middle of this maelstrom, sits a 53-year-old baseball man who’s a bazillion games into his baseball life but just 107 games into his managerial career. This can’t just be about Dusty Baker no longer being here or about hiring someone who had never managed. Shoot, half the division leaders in baseball are managed by men who had no prior experience in the position: Alex Cora in Boston, Gabe Kapler in Philadelphia and Torey Lovullo in Arizona. Throw in Aaron Boone, in his first year with the Yankees, and Dave Roberts, now in his third year with the Dodgers, and there’s plenty of precedent for first-time managers to excel. “I just think he’s a manager that you’re able to talk to each and every day,” said Martinez’s most vocal supporter in the dugout, Nats star Bryce Harper. “His door is wide open. He’ll do anything he can for anybody in this clubhouse.” [Ryan Zimmerman couldn’t stop smiling during Mets shortstop Jose Reyes’s pitching debut] Such support is important. But it’s also worth pointing out that Martinez did not bench Harper when the slugger failed to run out a groundball last month in New York but did bench Trea Turner following a similar occurrence last week in Miami. Players pay attention. They particularly home in on discrepancies. And what they’re watching is a manager who’s still learning — not the game, and not how to relate to people, but how to take charge of situations that might otherwise fester. The coaching staff and front office have to help. But the manager must take charge. “What I’ve learned is [be] patient,” Martinez said. “I think I’ve been very patient in adversity. .\\u2009.\\u2009. For me, it’s about taking care of the seconds, and the minutes, hours and days will take care of themselves.” The seconds have, at times, seemed to move pretty quickly for Martinez. Yet in the midst of all this, the Nationals won two ballgames they needed to win. “Everything is behind us now,” Martinez said. “The trade deadline — everything. I’ve told those guys, I said, ‘If we play baseball like we’re capable of playing, this is going to be really interesting.’\\u2009” It’s already interesting. And really, everything they want is still in front of them. What they’ll find out is whether the man obsessing over those seconds can help make the days and weeks to come matter.

They had smashed the New York Mets to pieces less than 12 hours earlier, a blowout featuring all sorts of franchise records, but another cloud, the latest in a 72-hour storm front, was hanging over the locker that Shawn Kelley had occupied for 2½ seasons. Kelley wasn’t there anymore. His nameplate had been removed. His presence was erased and replaced by Jimmy Cordero because Kelley had spiked his glove and glared into the Nationals’ dugout out of frustration after allowing a home run in the ninth inning of Tuesday’s rout. General Manager Mike Rizzo designated Kelley for assignment a few hours later after trading Brandon Kintzler, whom the Nationals believed was a malcontent. Rizzo acted swiftly and defiantly. [Mike Rizzo delivers a message for Nationals: ‘If you’re not in, you’re in the way’] Unlike Tuesday night’s thrashing, Wednesday’s 5-3 matinee win over the Mets did not end on a sour note. It was as routine as a journeyman outdueling a bona fide ace gets. The Nationals pounced on Noah Syndergaard early, watched Tommy Milone sparkle over seven innings and added insurance in their last at-bats to give the new-look bullpen some breathing room. They’re back over .500 at 54-53 and stand five games out of first place in the National League East. A two-game sample size regularly proves to be fool’s good, but it’s a start for a stubborn club seeking to turn the corner down the stretch. “It’s going to take a village, and they know that,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “This is a pivotal time of year.” The Nationals didn’t unload another batch of fireworks following Tuesday’s historic showing, but they jumped out front on Syndergaard when Bryce Harper’s single up the middle in the first inning scored Trea Turner, who had stolen the first of his two bases to get in scoring position. Harper finished 2 for 4 and with a .226 batting average — the highest that stat has been since the middle of June. [Wednesday’s box score: Nationals 5, Mets 3] “He’s playing the way he’s capable of playing,” Martinez said. “He’s really doing well. And it really started in Miami [over the weekend] — using the whole field, not trying to do too much. And I told him, ‘Just play the game.’ He’s hustling everywhere. If he continues to do that, we’re going to have a lot of fun.” In the third inning, Anthony Rendon extended the Nationals’ lead to 3-0 with a two-run homer, his 16th of the season. Meanwhile, the 31-year-old Milone, a Mets castoff filling in for the injured Stephen Strasburg for a second time, was silencing the anemic New York lineup. The left-hander compiled six strikeouts through three innings. He kept the Mets scoreless until the fifth, when Jose Reyes, who had made his pitching debut the previous night, socked a solo home run. The homer was Reyes’s first since April 29 and his second this season, matching the total he allowed on the mound Tuesday. [Ryan Zimmerman couldn’t stop smiling during Mets shortstop Jose Reyes’s pitching debut] After pitching to an 8.56 ERA in 11 appearances for the Mets last season, Milone limited his former team to the one run across seven innings Wednesday. He compiled nine strikeouts, his most since 2013 and one short of his career high, and he didn’t walk a batter. “You know what? Milone made some pretty good pitches,” Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said. “Now, we probably should’ve been able to challenge him a little bit better, but he had a pretty nice change-up working. He elevated the fastball well, kind of went north and south on us, and executed his pitches. It’d be nice to put a little more pressure on him than we did.” The 97-pitch outing, which followed Tanner Roark’s strong start (one run in seven innings) Tuesday, extended the Nationals rotation’s recent success: Over the past week, Washington’s starters have the best ERA in the National League. It’s a tiny sample size, but it’s encouraging. The Nationals are a dangerous team when their starting rotation is good. They’re bad when it’s not. This season is evidence. Milone has contributed by allowing four runs in two starts across 12 innings during his second career stint with Washington. The games have been against the Miami Marlins and the Mets, the NL East’s bottom feeders, but Nationals starters not named Max Scherzer spent the previous two-plus months regularly tripping over teams all across the spectrum. “It’s huge. That’s exactly the spot you want to be in, really,” Milone said. “I’m excited to be here. I’m happy I’m getting this opportunity.” [Brandon Kintzler on rumors of clubhouse leaking: ‘That’s an interesting accusation’] Milone’s performance was necessary because Syndergaard settled in. Making his first start since coming off the disabled list following a bout with hand, foot and mouth disease, Syndergaard retired 12 straight batters after Rendon’s home run. He then surrendered a leadoff single to Daniel Murphy in the seventh inning but escaped unscathed. Syndergaard’s effort kept it a two-run game, a lead that Reyes halved with an eighth-inning solo home run off Ryan Madson for his 11th career multihomer game. Suddenly, the Nationals’ bullpen was in a high-pressure spot for the first time without closer Sean Doolittle and Kintzler. Madson did not yield another run, though, and Washington tacked on two to pad the cushion for Kelvin Herrera to handle the ninth inning. The Nationals needed the extra leeway when Herrera allowed a Wilmer Flores flyball to the warning track that a leaping Juan Soto knocked over the wall for a solo home run. Herrera then surrendered a double to Michael Conforto and walked Jose Bautista before getting Brandon Nimmo to ground into a game-ending double play. It wasn’t easy, but Herrera didn’t slam his glove, and the Nationals won again, this time without a bitter finish.

(Gus Ruelas/Associated Press)   by Cindy Boren August 1 at 1:39 PM Email the author   Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott has gotten an earful since he told reporters last week that he doesn’t think a football game “is the time or the venue” for demonstrations and protests during the national anthem, a stance that was more closely aligned with owner Jerry Jones than with many of his co-workers. Prescott is trying his best to set the record straight, saying this week that he wasn’t oblivious to the criticism, and trying to explain what sets him apart from Jones, whose my-way-or-the-highway position reportedly led the NFL to stifle him as it tries to work out a viable anthem policy with the NFL Players Association. “You get on social media you see it. It doesn’t bother me,” Prescott told Clarence E. Hill Jr. of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “I said what I said. You have an opinion. Everyone else has an opinion. They are entitled to it as well. I accepted what they said and respect it. They should respect mine.” Prescott’s opinion from last week? “I never protest during the anthem, and I don’t think that’s the time or the venue to do so,” he said. “The game of football has always brought me such peace, and I think it does the same for a lot of people — a lot of people playing the game, a lot of people watching the game, a lot of people who have any impact of the game — so when you bring such controversy to the stadium, to the field, to the game, it takes away. It takes away from that, it takes away from the joy and the love that football brings a lot of people. “For me, I’m all about making a change and making a difference, and I think this whole kneeling and all of that was just about raising awareness and the fact that we’re still talking about social injustice years later, I think we’ve gotten to that point. I think we’ve proved, we know the social injustice. I’m up for taking the next step whatever the next step may be for action and not just kneeling. I’ve always believed standing up for what I believe in, and that’s what I’m going to continue to do.” Not everyone heard all of that, though. [Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen rips Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for his anthem stance and for not following it himself] The Raiders’ Tahir Whitehead tweeted that “it looks like Dak don’t [sic] want to lose that Campbell’s Chunky Soup deal!” The Undefeated defended him by using the headline: “Dak Prescott isn’t a race traitor because he thinks there’s a better way to protest.” Prescott became the subject of endless debate on sports networks and radio stations. And Twitter was on fire over the matter. “I think there was a little misunderstanding of the fact of what I believe in,” Prescott told Hill. “I never said I didn’t believe in social injustice and things that were going on. I just said I didn’t think that the national anthem was the time. It’s two minutes out of our day that we could also be spending embracing what our country should be and what our country is going to be one day that we know that it’s not right now. That is the sad part about it — that it’s not. “I respect everybody. And power to the people that kneel. That is what they believe in and they should be able to kneel. For me, the game of football has been such a peace. It’s a moment for me to be at peace and think about all the great things our country does have even though we know it’s not a good for us right now.” As he said, he prefers community involvement to symbolism. “I am for the action,” Prescott said. “I am for joining [the Philadelphia Eagles’] Malcolm [Jenkins] and joining those guys in doing something different. That is what I mean my taking that next step rather than just kneeling or standing. I don’t think kneeling or standing is creating a solution for us.” Jones helped resurrect the national anthem debate last week, saying that “our policy [for players] is you stand for the anthem, toe on the line.”\\xa0Stephen Jones, the Cowboys’ executive vice president, took his father’s position to another level, saying players should stand on the sideline “if they want to be a Dallas Cowboy.”\\xa0Although Jerry Jones later added that Trump’s “interest in what we’re doing is problematic,” the president\\xa0offered his support\\xa0for Jones, one of the NFL owners taking a hard line on the issue, in a tweet: “Way to go Jerry. This is what the league should do!” Richard Sherman, now with the San Francisco 49ers, blasted Jones for his “old plantation mentality,” adding, “What did you expect?” That led to reports that Jones had been told\\xa0by the NFL to pipe down as it and the NFLPA try to work\\xa0out an agreement, with the regular season bearing down Sept. 6.

Swimming at the\\xa0Far Western Long Course Championships in Moraga, Calif., Apuada finished the 100-meter butterfly in 1:09.38, besting Phelps’s 23-year-old, 10-and-under meet record of\\xa01:10.48 by more than a second. “That was one of my dreams — to beat Michael Phelps’s record — since I was 7,” Apuado said in the above video. In 1996, Phelps set the overall U.S. 10-and-under record for the 100 butterfly at\\xa01:08.54, a mark that since has been bested by Carson Foster in 2012 (1:07.24) and then Andrew Rogers, who broke the record twice at a 2015 meet in Texas. Rogers’s 1:05.98 still stands as the 10-and-under U.S. record in the 100 butterfly. Apuada, a rising fifth-grader who has been swimming competitively for four years, ended up with gold medals in every event he swam in at the meet, winning the 200 individual medley, 50 butterfly, 50 backstroke, 100 backstroke, 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle to go along with his 100 butterfly crown. As for his nickname, Apuada’s mother Cynthia told the Huffington Post that she always liked the name Clark and that her husband’s favorite superhero was Superman, and everything just flowed naturally from there. “We’re always just telling people his name is Clark. But when they realize his full name, people just call him Superman,” Cynthia Apuada said. Not to get too far into the (nerdy) weeds here, but Arthur Curry Apuada perhaps would have been a more apt name.

By this point, there was one out in the inning and a runner on first. “Behind a 5-3 victory, New York’s lovable losers were champions,” he said. “The Orioles led 3-0 early, but home runs by [Donn] Clendenon and [Al] Weis tied the game. In the eighth, [Ron] Swoboda gave the Mets the lead with an RBI double. [Jerry] Koosman induced future Mets manager Davey Johnson to fly out to Cleon Jones in left field for the final out.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Rick Maese July 30 Email the author   The teams that compete under the Monumental Sports & Entertainment banner are dissimilar in so many ways, and thus, the athletes who compete for Monumental in professional basketball, hockey, indoor football and even video gaming have different medical needs and training regimens. But they’ll now share a medical provider and an innovative new model under a deal that could be one of the most wide-reaching health-care partnerships in professional sports. The Ted Leonsis-run pro sports enterprise announced a 10-year agreement Monday that gives MedStar Health naming rights for three Washington-area practice facilities: the Capitals’ training rinks in Arlington, formerly called Kettler Capitals Iceplex; the new basketball training facility in Southeast Washington that will house the Wizards, the Mystics and the Capital City Go-Go, the city’s new G League team; and the training space used by Wizards District Gaming, the esports team that competes in the NBA 2K League and practices in a facility adjacent to Capital One Arena. “We are thrilled to enter into this innovative partnership with them that will bring MedStar’s unparalleled excellence in health care to every single team in the Monumental Sports family,” Leonsis said in a statement. “We hope that this expanded partnership will help reimagine the way teams in professional sports approach delivering the very best medical care.” The deal was formally announced at a news conference Monday morning in Arlington. Financial terms were not disclosed. Under the naming rights deal, the esports training facility in Chinatown will become the MedStar Wizards District Gaming Studio. The Capitals’ Arlington facility, which has become a popular destination for fans to watch practices and morning skates, will become MedStar Capitals Iceplex. (That facility had been known as Kettler Capitals Iceplex since it opened in the fall of 2006.) And the practice facility at Washington’s new basketball arena, the $65 million project in Ward 8 on the former St. Elizabeths hospital grounds, will be named MedStar Wizards Performance Center. It is expected to open this fall; the arena itself does not yet have a naming rights deal. “We are also very proud to have MedStar join us in bringing their powerful brand to southeast Washington,” Leonsis said. “We are focused on making the MedStar Wizards Performance Center a vibrant part of the community in Anacostia, and we are thrilled to have MedStar partner with us in this effort.” [He quit his State Department job to play video games. Now he’s a star in the NBA’s 2K League.] MedStar Health already provided health-care services and sponsored training camp and practice-jersey patches for the Wizards and Capitals. The new deal encompasses all of the Monumental teams, including its two Arena Football League franchises, and aims to create a novel health-care model, according to Monumental officials. MedStar will establish a council of medical professionals who provide services to the teams. That council will assess, discuss and administer best practices and training techniques for each squad. A single medical director will be appointed to oversee the entire operation.\\xa0The council will meet monthly, alongside trainers, coaches and team executives, to exchange ideas and best practices and to discuss what they’re seeing on each roster and in each discipline. “We think we can get a competitive advantage in treating every sport and every player so they can get to their top-top performance parameters,” Leonsis said at Monday’s news conference. “That’s why this partnership is just so meaningful for us.” Jim Van Stone, Monumental’s president of business operations, said the arrangement is potentially “game-changing,” allowing constant discussion and ensuring that each team will be keep abreast of the most advanced sports medicine regimens, sports training techniques and new technologies. “Having one partner across all properties really allows you to open up the dialogue and the communication on what’s really the most cutting-edge techniques and preparing athletes for peak performance,” he said. “I think the integration of the medical council allows, really, that open dialogue among the teams. Each of the sports we have here at Monumental is just completely different.” MedStar is not the only medical provider to enter into a high-profile agreement with a Washington professional sports team. In 2016, the Redskins renamed their Ashburn headquarters the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park, and the team’s Richmond training camp is sponsored by Bon Secours Health System. But Monumental’s varied holdings could make its new deal more noteworthy. “The collaboration of all these different training teams and medical teams really working together, I think, is really going to put us in a fantastic position,” Van Stone said. “I don’t think there’s another opportunity out there that brings all these different facets under one umbrella.” More sports coverage from The Post: Capitals re-sign forward Tom Wilson to six-year deal Dwight Howard has been the star of the show.

Happ beat the Royals in his Yankees debut Sunday. (Noah K. Murray/USA Today)   by Cindy Boren August 1 at 10:03 AM Email the author   Pitcher J.A. Happ, acquired by the New York Yankees in a trade late last week, has been diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, becoming the second Major League Baseball pitcher afflicted over the last two weeks. Happ was diagnosed with what the team said is a mild case; it is unclear how he came down with a viral disease most common among children under the age of 5. One possibility is that he was infected on a commercial cross-country flight after being traded Thursday by the Toronto Blue Jays. “I got a call from our trainer,” General Manager Brian Cashman told reporters. “He said, ‘I’m not sure what’s going on here, but J.A. Happ has some complaints. He’s not feeling right, and he had noticed some blistering.’ ” Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard was the first player afflicted this summer. He was placed on the 10-day disabled list with the illness, which is highly contagious, on July 22 after a start at Yankee Stadium. The Mets believe Syndergaard came down with the disease when he visited a kids’ camp over the all-star break. Syndergaard is expected to be activated Wednesday. The Yankees do not, for now, plan to place Happ on the disabled list. Happ is 11-6 after winning his Yankees debut Sunday, and Cashman said he “probably” would be able to start against the Red Sox in the four-game series that begins Thursday at Fenway Park. He is scheduled to pitch Saturday. “I can only convey to you what our internist who evaluated Happ conveyed to me,” Cashman said. “He feels currently this is a mild case, but he’ll stay connected.\\xa0We’ll be in a better position [Wednesday] to evaluate whether this is toward the tail end of this thing or if it’s ramping up.” For Syndergaard, one clue that he was ill came during a start in which the velocity of his pitches was low and he was having trouble breathing. Happ complained of blisters on his hands when he arrived at Yankee Stadium and was sent to New York Presbyterian Hospital.\\xa0Symptoms,\\xa0according to the Mayo Clinic, can include fever; sore throat; malaise; painful, blister-like lesions; and a red rash. Although people afflicted with the virus are most contagious during the first week, it can remain in the body for weeks after symptoms and signs are gone. Some people — especially adults — can pass the virus (often by coughing or sneezing) without showing any symptoms of the ailment. “There’s no real treatment. You just monitor the patient and let the virus take its course,” Cashman said. “He’s still scheduled to start. That’s not something that as of now is in jeopardy as of yet. . . . [O]ur internist felt if everything is as is right now, he probably would be able to go on Saturday.

(Nick Wass/Associated Press)   by Neil Greenberg July 30 Email the author   The MLB nonwaiver trade deadline is 4 p.m. Tuesday, and it’s time for the Washington Nationals, who are 52-53 and six games back in the National League East, to face reality and turn free agent contracts into future assets such as prospects and draft picks — and, yes, that includes six-time all-star outfielder Bryce Harper. Harper’s expected contract demands are well-known by now — his price tag projects to be north of $300 million — and with Washington so far in the rear-view mirror of true playoff contenders, it would make a lot of sense for the Nationals to convert Harper into future value. But General Manager Mike Rizzo seemed hesitant to commit to such a move when asked Wednesday by the Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan. [There is only one AL playoff spot up for grabs. Who’s excited?] “It would have to be a spectacular set of circumstances for us to do that,” Rizzo\\xa0said during the segment. “We’re going to do what we have to do to better this team for 2018 and beyond. That’s one of the superstars in the game and he’s a guy that is near and dear to my heart personally, and in Washington D.C., and is one of the great players in the game.” “Great” may be stretching it. Sure, Harper was the unanimous NL MVP in 2015 after an out-of-this-world campaign in which he hit .330 with a major-league leading 1.109 OPS and a league-leading 42 home runs, but that year has been the exception, with his other six seasons in the majors a mixed bag. Injuries limited him to less than a full season in 2014 and 2017, and he hit just .243 with 24 home runs in 147 games in 2016. He did add 21 stolen bases that season, but when looked at through the lens of wins above replacement (3.0 WAR, as calculated by FanGraphs) Harper was just the 12th-best NL outfielder that year. And that’s the kind of production the Nationals can expect if they hold on to Harper beyond Tuesday, at least according to\\xa0Dan Szymborski’s ZiPS projections and Steamer’s estimates for the rest of the season. According to those estimates, adjusted for projected playing time, Harper will hit .270 with 12 home runs, producing an additional 1.6 or 1.7 fWAR through the end of 2018. And that might be optimistic, considering the reasons Harper is struggling this season.    2018 regular season G PA HR R RBI SB AVG OPS fWAR   Bryce Harper (through Sunday) 103 450 25 63 62 8 .220 .842 1.6   ZiPS projections (rest of season) 50 215 12 33 33 4 .268 .923 1.6   Steamer projections (rest of season) 51 223 12 34 33 3 .271 .929 1.7    Harper has been struggling with fastballs, striking out in a career-high 25 percent of his plate appearances ending on that pitch. His walk rate this season is near where it was in 2015 (19.0 percent), but he is having trouble making contact on pitches up and away, lowering his overall OPS on these pitches to .994, compared with 1.117 last season and 1.196 in 2015.    Bryce Harper’s miss rate vs. fastballs in 2018 (TruMedia)  It’s conceivable that Harper makes an adjustment and lays off these pitches entirely during the rest of the season, but there is a more pressing issue: how often the defense has been using an infield shift when Harper is at the plate. The soon-to-be free agent\\xa0has faced\\xa0an infield shift in 192 of his 450 plate appearances (42.7 percent), resulting in a\\xa0batting average on balls in play of .240, leading him to create runs at a rate that is 58 percent lower than the league average after adjusting for league and park effects (42 wRC+). The\\xa0league average for BABIP against the shift is .298 this year, so it’s easy to see how much the shift is costing Harper.    Bryce Harper against the shift in 2018 (MLB)  With results like that, you can expect the shift to be used against Harper more, not less, making 1.7 fWAR over the next few months an optimistic projection. That also suggests the Nationals won’t get the boost they may be anticipating by keeping Harper on the roster. It also puts their playoff chances in serious doubt. [Nationals look listless as trade deadline approaches] Heading into Monday night’s games, Washington has a 42.5 percent chance at making the playoffs — not nearly high enough to justify keeping Harper on the roster past Tuesday’s deadline. It surely would take a lot for Washington to move Harper, and the team probably would only do so if it was certain it would not be able to re-sign him. But if the Nationals get a good enough offer, the smart move probably is to get a solid return on a slugger who more than likely won’t be able to lift his team into the postseason.

(Alex Gallardo/Associated Press)   by Neil Greenberg July 27 Email the author   On Tuesday, Todd Gurley and the Los Angeles Rams agreed to a four-year contract extension with $45 million guaranteed, the largest guarantee ever given to a running back. The deal keeps the AP Offensive Player of the Year in line to wear a Los Angeles uniform through the 2023 season. Gurley is certainly worthy of the historic deal. The first-round pick in the 2015 draft carried the ball 279 times for 1,305 yards and a league-leading 13 touchdowns last season, adding 788 yards and six touchdowns on 64 catches. That made him one of the NFL’s most potent weapons at the position. [At a ‘young’ 34 years old, Redskins QB Alex Smith says ‘my best football’s still ahead of me’] Other rushers took notice — especially Pittsburgh Steelers all-pro running back Le’Veon Bell, who has yet to sign his one-year franchise tender to start what could be his final season with the franchise.

And that could be a mistake.   lol and ppl thought I was trippin?...— Le'Veon Bell (@LeVeonBell) July 24, 2018    Gurley, who turns 24 in August, has a couple of years left in his prime. Bell, at 26, does not. That might sound harsh for players who are only two years apart, but the life span of a running back in the NFL is not long. ESPN’s Bill Barnwell pointed this out, showing how even rushers at the top of the leader board don’t survive much longer than five years.   Put this in the column today but think it’s also worth mentioning in graphical form. Here are the leaders in passing, receiving, and rushing yards from five years ago (2013) per @pfref. The lines blotted out in red are for players who aren’t on an NFL roster. pic.twitter.com/L0005bW8N0— Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) July 25, 2018    Here’s another way to look at it, using the scoring format from point-per-reception, or PPR, leagues in fantasy football. It’s not a perfect measure of a running back’s performance, but it will illustrate how a top-performing running back ages. And it gives extra credit to do-it-all backs like Gurley and Bell, who not only carry the ball but catch passes out of the backfield as well. Since 2000, there have been 31 running backs who played in the NFL at age 21. More than half (17) improved their PPR point total the following year. The same rate of backs improved during their age-22 to age-23 season, and they kept improving until they reached 27. Then we started to see a decline — and it wasn’t a subtle one: Just over one-third of rushers (38 percent) improved their performance from 27 to 28. At 30 or older, the improvement rate slowed even more.     This is why taking a wait-and-see approach with Bell makes sense: Statistically speaking, he has one or two years left in his prime before he starts to decline. The same is true for David Johnson of the Arizona Cardinals. He turns 27 in December and, even through he has less mileage — 573 touches in 33 games over three seasons — his age is still a concern. Over the past decade, the amount of running backs who see 200 or more touches in a season peaks at age 25 and 26 and then starts a steady decline before almost falling off a cliff at age 29 and older. If the Cardinals’ front office decides to give Johnson a long-term deal with guaranteed money that extends into this age range, it is setting itself up for disappointment, as would any franchise in a similar situation.

Martin (@ByKimberleyA) July 26, 2018    However, the absence of weaknesses is countered by a lack of perceived strengths and, as a result, the Redskins are not expected to be competitive in 2018; per the preseason point spreads released by CG Technology in May, Washington is favored in just four games this season, all at home: Week 2 vs. the Indianapolis Colts (-3),\\xa0Week 6 vs. the Carolina Panthers (-1),\\xa0Week 7 vs. the Dallas Cowboys (-1) and\\xa0Week 14 vs. the New York Giants (-1.5). Knowing the point spreads for each week allows us to project how many wins the Redskins will have in 2018. For example, a team that is favored by one point at home can be expected to win 51 percent of the time. Using this method for each of the 16 games of the season estimates Washington is most likely to finish 2018 having earned between five and eight wins, with a 7-9 record the most likely outcome. The Redskins have just a 31 percent chance of finishing 8-8 or better. Skeptical? This also falls in line with the over/under win total set at seven for Washington.     As you would expect, seven or even eight wins won’t be enough to contend for the division title, and it looks like the Redskins will finish last or second to last in the NFC East behind the Philadelphia Eagles and Cowboys.     According to Sharp Sports, Washington has the ninth-toughest schedule, and it will face six of the league’s top 10 toughest opponents. Two other opponents, the Panthers and Cowboys, rank 11th and 12th.    (sharpfootballstats.com)  The most challenging part of the schedule is toward the end of the season, when the Redskins will be on the road against the Cowboys (Week 12), Eagles (Week 13), Jacksonville Jaguars (Week 15) and Tennessee Titans (Week 16). Based on the preliminary point spreads, Washington has less than a 33 percent chance to win each of those games, making the first half of the season that much more important.     As you can see, there is little room for error, with Gruden and his squad needing to make the most of the season’s first half. If not, Washington could flounder more than expected, with the possibility of a four- or five-win season within reach.

Then all that white briefly turned into a blur on the left sideline, legs firing like pistons. This was the Chris Thompson fans are desperate to see. The Florida State product continues to work his way back from a fractured fibula that ended his 2017 season after 10 games. He’s finally reestablishing himself as a dangerous weapon out of the backfield, particularly in passing situations. Tuesday was the most work Thompson has received in training camp as coaches ease him back on the field. “Was a little nervous just getting out there at first,” Thompson said. “Overall it felt good. As I continued to get going, I kind of got in my groove again and was able to go out and make some plays. I was fine.” [As new helmet rule creates confusion around NFL, Redskins unsure how it will be enforced] Thompson’s best moment Tuesday came on a misdirection screen to the left in which Alex Smith tossed the ball a bit high toward his running back. Thompson was able to tip it to himself, gain control and turn up the sideline. The sight in front of him was green grass — and 300-plus-pound linemen. Thompson later caught a touchdown from Colt McCoy down near the 10-yard line. He came out of the backfield, gave linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons a shimmy to get open and caught a slant to score. “A touchdown,” Thompson replied when asked what he saw on the screen. “O-line did a great job blocking the corner and that was the only guy that was out there. The safety was on the far hash. “I would think in a game-time situation he wouldn’t catch me. But last year I did get caught by [Oakland’s} David Amerson, so I don’t know. I guess I’m not as fast as I thought I was. I think I would’ve had a chance to score on that screen play.” There is a bit of discussion of how fast Thompson is. He appears plenty quick and fast, with that burst he’s known for. He doesn’t necessarily feel that way though. “Little bit, not completely just yet,” Thompson said. “But everybody’s telling me I look fast and I look quick, so I’ll take their word for it. “Like the doctors told me, it’ll probably be 18 months [from the initial injury] before I’m feeling like myself again. If I look good to them right now, I’ll take that.” Thompson expects to continue to be limited at practice, but believes he’ll receive a similar amount of action in the next couple sessions before increasing his workload. The Redskins need him to be a versatile, change-of-pace back, part of an expected 1-2 punch with rookie Derrius Guice, for the offense to reach its potential in 2018. “When you’re talking about your best players Chris and Jordan [Reed] and Trent [Williams] and Morgan [Moses] and some of these guys,” Coach Jay Gruden said before practice, “they got to get out there and practice, but it’s sometimes you just want to treat them like a china doll. You’re like, ‘Oh, please don’t get hit.’ But eventually they’re going to have to put the pads on and practice. “And Chris is getting to a point right now, we’re going to put him in some team periods today, watch the reps he has and the defense will take good care of him because they know what kind of value he has to this football team. But, he’s coming along great and I anticipate him being full go sooner than later.” More on the\\xa0Redskins: Jamison Crowder-Alex Smith connection is starting to flourish Redskins rookie Tim Settle taking advantage of extra opportunities First-round pick Daron Payne out 2-3 weeks with ankle injury Vernon Davis confident in this year’s offense: ‘This is one of the best teams I’ve ever been on’ ', 'Redskins RB Chris Thompson getting his ‘groove’ back as he nears full health - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capitals-insider/wp/2018/07/27/capitals-re-sign-popular-forward-tom-wilson-to-six-year-extension/': ('Capitals right wing Tom Wilson has more to celebrate this summer.

In a deal long expected, Washington will pay Wilson $31 million over six seasons, an average of $5.17 million, according to a press release the team sent Friday night. “Tom is an invaluable member of our team, and we are pleased that he will play a great part in our foreseeable future,” General Manager Brian MacLellan said in the statement. “Tom is a unique player in this league. At 24 years of age, he has an impressive amount of experience, and we believe that he will only continue to grow and improve as a player. With his ability to play in virtually any game situation, teams need players like Tom in order to succeed in the NHL.” [Tom Wilson and the Capitals will reach a deal. The questions: When, and for how much?] Wilson’s 14 goals, 21 assists and 15:59 average ice time during the regular season were career highs.\\xa0The 6-foot-4, 218-pounder scored five goals and added 10 assists during the postseason, though his most memorable moment might have been his hit on the Penguins’ Zach Aston-Reese in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. The league suspended Wilson for three games, but he returned the following series and continued his hard-hitting play. It was one of three suspensions for him last season. Wilson, who earned $2.25 million last season, was a restricted free agent, meaning the Capitals owned his negotiating rights. He opted not to file for arbitration. Without arbitration, it was possible negotiations could have lasted until training camp. “6 more years in DC!! Love this team and love this city. Beyond excited to stay a part of the Capitals family!” Wilson tweeted. After re-signing defenseman Madison Bowey to a two-year, $2 million deal last week and Brooks Orpik to a one-year $1 million contract Tuesday, Washington had roughly $6.2 million in cap space for the upcoming season. Several industry insiders projected the team would have to pay Wilson between $3.5 million and $4.5 million per year. In that sense, the player might have won this negotiation, but the Caps are locking up a 24-year-old who was their first-round pick in 2012 and has consistently improved. This past season, he spent the majority of his minutes on the top line with captain Alex Ovechkin and also was one of the team’s top penalty-killers. He is perhaps the Capitals’ most physical player, with a well-deserved reputation as the team’s enforcer. According to the website dropyourgloves.com, Wilson engaged in 18 fights in 2017-18 — including one in the playoffs — and won 13 of the exchanges.

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)   by Mike Hume July 24 Email the author   The Washington Capitals announced Tuesday that free agent defenseman Brooks Orpik will return to the team on a one-year contract that carries a salary cap hit of $1 million. The move ensures the Capitals will return all six defensemen who played for them in the Stanley Cup finals as they claimed the franchise’s first championship, a group that also includes Michal Kempny and John Carlson, each of whom re-signed earlier this offseason. The Capitals had traded Orpik to the Colorado Avalanche, along with goaltender Philipp Grubauer, at the NHL draft to clear Orpik’s $5.5 million salary cap hit from their books, in part to find money to keep Kempny and Carlson. The Avalanche elected to buy out the 37-year-old’s deal, making him a free agent. [The Stanley Cup tracker: Where will the Caps take it next?] “Brooks has been a valuable player and a great mentor for our young players, and we are thrilled to bring him back to our organization,” Capitals General Manager Brian MacLellan said. “We feel his leadership and competitiveness on and off the ice will be welcomed back to our group.” Orpik drew criticism as his contract neared its final season, largely because of his lack of speed in a league that increasingly prioritizes the trait. That criticism was amplified given a salary cap hit that made him Washington’s seventh-highest-paid player in terms of annual average value last season. The Capitals’ players, coaches and executives all lauded Orpik’s leadership and attitude, citing it as a key factor in their recent success. The one-year term and $1 million price tag — which could include another $500,000 in performance bonuses — is a far more team-friendly deal, and Orpik again will provide leadership for a roster that figures to incorporate more young players in the coming season. His presence also will make it tougher for some of the team’s defensive prospects — such as Madison Bowey, recently re-signed on a two-year deal, and 2016 first-round draft pick Lucas Johansen — to crack Washington’s lineup. The team has been successful in keeping most of its championship roster in place, save Grubauer and fourth-line center Jay Beagle, who signed with the Vancouver Canucks.\\xa0After the Orpik signing, the Capitals have roughly $7 million in salary cap space to work with as they attempt to finalize a new contract with winger Tom Wilson, a restricted free agent.

(Patrick Smith/Getty Images)   by Isabelle Khurshudyan July 19 Email the author   The Washington Capitals re-signed defenseman Madison Bowey to a two-year, $2 million deal, the team announced Thursday. Bowey was a restricted free agent, and the extension leaves the Capitals with just one player left to sign: right wing Tom Wilson. After Washington drafted Bowey in the second round in 2013, he made his NHL debut this past season, appearing in 51 games with an average ice time of 13:43. Although the 23-year-old didn’t appear in any playoff games, he’s expected to be on the NHL roster again next season, and that it’s a one-way contract for both years of his new deal supports that. The Capitals now have six defensemen under contract, and General Manager Brian MacLellan said adding a veteran blue-liner was a consideration, especially with Bowey and Christian Djoos entering just their sophomore campaigns. MacLellan confirmed Washington was in discussions with veteran Brooks Orpik, whom the team traded to Colorado at the draft in a salary cap-clearing move. The Avalanche bought out the last year of Orpik’s deal, making him an unrestricted free agent. The 37-year-old remains unsigned. “We’re still in discussions with maybe one or two free agents,” MacLellan said July 3. “There’s a trade-off: We think Madison can take the step to the next level, and same with Djoos. They both played well this year, and I think they’re going to improve as we go this year.” Bowey’s contract leaves the Capitals with roughly $7.2 million in cap space, and they have 21 players under contract. Wilson, a restricted free agent, did not elect for arbitration, so it’s unclear how long his contract negotiations might take. His agent, Mark Guy, said this week that, while there has been regular dialogue with Washington, a new deal isn’t “done or close.” The sides are exploring an extension potentially “north of four years,” which could mean an average annual value in the neighborhood of $4 million. Assuming Wilson’s deal gets done, the Capitals, who won the franchise’s first Stanley Cup last month, would be in line to return six of their defensemen from last season as well as their entire top-nine forward corps.

(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)   by Candace Buckner July 30 Email the author   With the majority of the Washington Wizards’ offseason transactions complete, owner Ted Leonsis said he believes the moves have created perhaps the most balanced roster in franchise history. On Monday, the founder of Monumental Sports & Entertainment reviewed the summer in which the Wizards signed free agents Dwight Howard and Jeff Green and swung a trade for Austin Rivers. Last season, the team regressed amid injuries to John Wall and struggled to play consistently. Washington finished 43-39, earning six fewer wins than it had the previous year, and advanced to the playoffs as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards lost in the first round to the top-seeded Toronto Raptors in six games. In the owner’s view, the offseason renovations should make Washington a force in the East. “If you look at this roster for the Wizards, I think it’s as deep or the deepest team that we’ve ever had,” Leonsis said. “I think that the East will be very competitive, but I don’t think we should be overlooked. I think we’re going to have a really good team this year.” Leonsis, speaking after his Monumental Sports & Entertainment group announced a practice-facility naming-rights partnership with MedStar, said the Wizards addressed specific areas of concern. The Howard signing filled the hole in the middle after the team shipped center Marcin Gortat to the Los Angeles Clippers for Rivers. During his 14-year career, Howard has averaged 17.4 points, 12.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game, and he comes to Washington with the practical price tag of $5.3 million. While Howard, 32, should be an improvement on the older Gortat, he still brings baggage. In consecutive summers, Howard has been dumped by his two previous teams, and over time he has taken blows to his reputation. [Dwight Howard could provide a pick-me-up in the Wizards’ most used play] “I think that’s a media-generated issue. I don’t think it’s a basketball-related issue,” Leonsis said about Howard. “He could’ve signed in many, many places, and really it all comes down to the salary cap. Dwight is paid like a max player. We’re paying him the mid-level exception. He will be a great addition to the team, he wants to be here, and his skill set is what we needed: someone who could run, play defense and rebound. And he’s at the time of his career right now where he’s been paid a lot of money; he’s still getting paid max money [with] the buyout and what we’re paying him. … So, at that price, I think he was the greatest addition we could add at that position.” Although the Wizards lost a bench scorer in Mike Scott, who had the third-highest three-point shooting percentage on the team last year, Leonsis has confidence in veteran reserves Green and Rivers. When asked to evaluate the summer, Leonsis, who also owns the Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals, compared the Wizards to his more successful team. “I thought both front offices had ‘A’ grades for their offseason. I think that when a season ends, you sit down and say, ‘This is what we want to accomplish,’ and for the Wizards, it was we need to have more balance and more depth and be prepared for injuries,” Leonsis said. “We had injuries last year and we want to be able to have interchangeable parts and players that are adapted to the new NBA. “From center position to wing to the backcourt,” Leonsis continued. “So we were able to bring in a lot of bench scoring, and I think we can go 10 to 11 players deep.” Read more: Wizards deleted Team USA photo of John Wall but couldn’t stop him from getting roasted Jerry Colangelo, one of the NBA’s elder statesmen, talks Team USA, the 76ers and more Dwight Howard has been the star of the show.

(Photo by Bob DeChiara/USA Today Sports)   by Candace Buckner July 27 Email the author   During the Washington Wizards’ first game of the Eastern Conference playoffs, Bradley Beal noticed a trend. The Toronto Raptors were alternating defenses when Beal operated as the ballhandler in pick-and-roll plays. They committed, switched and sometimes threw a hard hedge — when the defender on the screener jumps out on the ballhandler to slow down the action. After the Wizards lost Game 1, Beal sought a solution to Toronto’s tactics. “They did a good job of it, but I watched film,” Beal said April 17, the morning before Game 2, “and I think I got some counters that will beat their defenses.” He didn’t. As the Wizards’ ballhandlers tried to create basketball poetry, operating around the occasional hard pick mixed with too many halfhearted screens, the play was perforated as Washington fell into a two-game deficit. Enter one\\xa0of the most active roll men in the NBA. While many have dissected the Wizards’ decision to add Dwight Howard, who was traded from the Charlotte Hornets to the Brooklyn Nets, then negotiated a buyout to become a free agent, his new teammates can focus on the big man’s particular skill set. On a purely basketball front, a healthy Howard may cure Washington’s weaknesses in the pick and roll and improve any blind spots on the fast break. “Some of the narrative is out there that I heard, but I’m not concerned with it,” Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said Monday after Howard was officially introduced. “My focus is on him and what we’ve talked about and our relationship, what we’ll establish going forward.” [Wizards deleted Team USA photo of John Wall but couldn’t stop him from getting roasted] Last season, when the Wizards had a ballhandler blossoming in confidence in Beal; a big man willing to sacrifice his body for screens in Marcin Gortat; and, for only 41 games, the services of a five-time point guard deft in finding teammates in John Wall, the team often relied\\xa0on the pick and roll to create offense. Despite having personnel suited for the play, the Wizards were surprisingly inefficient as a pick-and-roll team. Washington\\xa0ranked below average in plays produced from the pick-and-roll ballhandler, 0.82 points per possession for 19th overall, according to NBA Advanced Stats. And even though Gortat finished fourth in the league in screen assists, the team recorded just 0.98 points per possession (27th in the league) when the action went to the roll man. The bread-and-butter play starts, naturally, with a pick and is designed to create an open shot for the ballhandler or a pass to the cutting screener. The Wizards, however, sometimes found the simple play more difficult, just as Beal experienced in Game 1 against the Raptors. On that night, Beal, who led the team with 510 possessions as the pick-and-roll ballhandler in 2017-18 according to Synergy Sports, often faced an extra defender after a teammate slipped the screen. Although that’s common in the NBA, a hard screen initiates the action, and the threat of the screener finishing near the rim is more likely to keep a defender from hedging the ballhandler. Gortat did not pose such a threat — he made only 45.5 percent of his shots on plays in which he rolled to the basket. Conversely, Howard shot 58.4 percent on the same plays last season for Charlotte. “He’s still athletic,” Wall said about Howard. “Look what he did last year: He averaged 16 and 12. He’s a guy who can still catch lobs and dunk the ball under the basket.” Still, Howard’s work as a roll man graded out as average on Synergy’s rating system. He performed better, however, in transition. The statistical website separately evaluated both Howard and the Wizards as excellent on transition plays, and Brooks already can envision how the big man would be most effective when the team elects to get out and run. [Dwight Howard has been the star of the show. With the Wizards, he’ll be part of the chorus.] “We want to play fast. How do you play fast? You don’t play fast by getting the ball … out through the net,” Brooks said. “You’ve got to get it off the rim and get out and run. He’s the best rebounder in the league, and to be able to do that, it creates offense for our guys that can play fast, that can shoot.” Howard averaged 12.5 rebounds, ranking third in the NBA behind Andre Drummond (16.0) and DeAndre Jordan (15.2), but even when he wasn’t concluding a defensive possession by securing the ball, the 265-pounder still hurried down the floor fast enough to finish many of Charlotte’s breaks. Howard completed 36 of 51 shot attempts in transition (nearly 71 percent) and drew free throws on 26.6 percent of those possessions. On the day of Game 2 between the Wizards and Raptors, Howard was busy in Charlotte holding a Jr. NBA clinic at the Dwight Howard Boys & Girls Club. Howard had missed the playoffs for only the fourth time in his 14-year career, and the Wizards were missing someone with his skills as an efficient roll man and transition scorer. Two months later, after Howard was dealt by the Hornets, he received an Instagram direct message from Wall asking whether he wanted to play in Washington. He said yes. The big man looking for a home found one with a team that needs a pick-and-roll boost. “I think we are going to really just shock a lot of people, and I think for me, the rest of this team and this organization, it’s all about winning. That is our mind-set,” Howard said. “That is the only thing that us as players have been talking about, myself, coach and also Ernie [Grunfeld, the general manager], how we are excited about turning things around here in D.C.” Read more from Post Sports: Alex Smith was a safe choice.

(Steven Goff/The Washington Post)   by Steven Goff July 31 at 2:56 PM Email the author   D.C. United’s Wayne Rooney returned to work Tuesday looking as if he had stepped into a boxing ring over the weekend. Bruises enveloped his left eye, and five stitches ran from the eyebrow to the bridge of his broken nose. “It looks a bit worse with the black eye,”\\xa0he said after participating in the training session, “but it feels fine.” Rooney and the team declared him available for the MLS match Saturday at Montreal, saying he had cleared two concussion tests and would not need significant treatment for the wounds, which were inflicted in the waning moments of a 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rapids on Saturday at Audi Field. Rooney was in the penalty area, helping to defend a corner kick in the fourth of five additional minutes, when Colorado’s Tommy Smith crashed into teammate Axel Sjoberg and created a chain reaction. The back of Sjoberg’s head then rammed Rooney’s face. Rooney fell, and when he got back up, his face was a bloody mess. Medical staff tended to him on the sideline as shorthanded United ran out the clock. “It was a complete accident,” Rooney said. “These things happen.” He said he has broken his nose “a few times” during his 16-year career and that “it’s part of football. I’m used to it.” He said he would be ready to play this weekend — “no problem” — and did not plan to wear a molded face mask. “It will be fine. It’s actually settled down quite quick,” he said. “There’s not much swelling. … I’ve had no problems sleeping. I’ll play as normal. Of course, if I get a bang on it, it will be painful.” United tested him for a concussion after the match and again Tuesday. Results were negative. Still, Coach Ben Olsen said, “We’ll be a little cautious with him this week.” Olsen said Rooney “doesn’t seem too bothered by it. … The thing to worry there is with the concussion stuff. The cuts heal. We all have broken noses; almost every guy out here has one. All of us can only breathe through one nostril. It’s part of the gig.” Rooney’s commitment to the cause, battling an opponent (Sjoberg) with a 10-inch height advantage, left an impression on his teammates. “He took one off the face to make sure nothing happened,” said goalkeeper David Ousted, who was also responsible for preventing Sjoberg from making contact. “It’s the kind of guy he is and the kind of guy we appreciate.” The incident came in Rooney’s first match as team captain, a title awarded after just a month with his new team. “It’s something you know these young players need,” said the former Manchester United and English national team captain. “I’ve been there as a young player. I remember as a young player getting advice from the likes of Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes — it’s what you want to take in if you want to take advice. If you don’t, that’s your decision. I can only be there to help.” The injury also came on the day he scored his first MLS goal, a 33rd-minute strike between goalkeeper Tim Howard’s legs. United conceded Kellyn Acosta’s equalizer in the 82nd minute and went back ahead on an own goal in the 90th. Aside from the injury forcing him to the sideline, Rooney went the distance after totaling 131 minutes in the first three outings. Barring any setbacks this week, Olsen hopes to play him most, if not all, of this weekend’s game. “This was the plan all along, to build him up to this point,” Olsen said. “It’s still a little bit fast, but that’s just the reality of coming in halfway through the season. If this was preseason, maybe it would be another week. He did a very good job in the offseason to maintain a level of fitness where he didn’t come in here unfit.” Rooney added, “I feel like I am up to speed.” His adaptation into the attack remains a promising work in progress as he bonds with Luciano Acosta, Yamil Asad, Zoltan Stieber and Paul Arriola. “We’ve created chances,” Rooney said. “If we had been more clinical in the last game, we could have been two or three-nil up and the game is finished. But it’s nice as an attacking player when you are creating chances. There are real positive signs.” Notes: With eight days left in the transfer and trade window, Olsen said the team is “still looking” for roster help, particularly at outside back. Taylor Kemp, the incumbent at left back, will miss the entire year with a hip injury and first-choice right back Nick DeLeon continues to struggle with a knee injury that has cost him eight games. … The club will offer a free ticket to a future match for fans who were not able to gain entrance to Audi Field last weekend because of a strict clear bag policy. The situation affected about 50 people, spokesman Chris Hull said. “It may be a small number, but it’s far too many,” he said. United implemented the guidelines a year before it will become mandatory at all MLS venues. The team has pledged to improve communication about the policy by prominently posting it on digital game tickets and social media and by stationing customer-service officials at the gates. The team is also reviewing its relationship with a third-party vendor, which did not provide enough lockers for fans to store belongings outside the stadium. Long lines formed Saturday, prompting some fans to leave or stash their bags unprotected outside the stadium. United will also review the $20 charge for a locker and whether to distribute clear bags for free or a minimal charge. The next home match is Aug. 12 against Orlando City.

(Anne-Marie Sorvin/USA Today Sports)   by Steven Goff July 29 Email the author   If Bayern Munich had any second thoughts about spending up to $22 million in transfer fees last week on a Canadian teenage attacker with no MLS goals before this year, they were put to rest in a ferocious and spectacular performance Saturday at Vancouver’s BC Place. Three months and a few days short of his 18th birthday, Alphonso Davies looked very much like someone ready to take the next step in his dawning soccer career and fulfill the massive expectations that are sure to shadow him to Bavaria this winter. He played a part in every Whitecaps goal, scoring twice on breathtaking sequences and assisting twice during a 4-2 victory over Minnesota United. While he was making outrageous runs in the Pacific Northwest, his future employer was in Miami with an American teenager in the starting lineup for a preseason friendly: defender Chris Richards, 18, on loan from FC Dallas. He will play for Bayern’s under-19 squad this season, but this summer Richards has entered as a substitute against Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus and played 90 minutes against Manchester City. Because he is too young for a formal transfer, Davies will remain with the Whitecaps through the end of the season and join Bayern Munich when the German transfer window reopens in January. The fee from the Bundesliga titans — a base of $13 million, with clauses that could result in additional payments — is the largest for an MLS player in the league’s 22-year history, besting the $11.6 million that Spanish side Villarreal spent 10 years ago on Jozy Altidore, then with the New York Red Bulls. The Whitecaps have pledged to pour that money into the sporting side of the club, such as youth development and player acquisitions. “He’s got a massive future, and it’s really up to him how far he goes,” said Minnesota defender Michael Boxall, who was burned by Davies on the first goal. “He’s got a great opportunity ahead of him.” He will carry a compelling personal story with him to Europe: Born in a Ghanaian refugee camp to parents fleeing civil war in Liberia, he relocated with his family to Ontario at age 5 before settling in Alberta. An Edmonton youth club that helped groom him will receive a small share of the Bayern transfer fee, a FIFA-required solidarity payment that MLS’s U.S. teams, citing antitrust laws, ignore. Davies’s career began to take shape in earnest at the Whitecaps’ youth academy three summers ago. Within six months, he had signed with the club’s lower-tier team in the United Soccer League. By the summer of 2016, at age 15, he had upgraded to an MLS contract. With the first team, he started twice in 2016 and nine times last year before becoming a regular this season. With European clubs monitoring him, he has scored five times and posted 10 assists in 21 regular season matches, which earned him a share of fourth place on the league charts entering Sunday’s matches. Davies scored a terrific individual goal against D.C. United in the Audi Field grand opening two weeks ago. He met with Bayern officials last week in Philadelphia, where the German club began a U.S. tour. A deal soon was finalized. He then returned to Vancouver for Saturday’s sensational performance, assisting on Yordy Reyna’s sublime goal in the 35th minute, beating three players in tight space to score in the 56th, setting up Kei Kamara on a two-on-one in the 64th and splitting two defenders and finding the top corner of the net in the 89th.   Simply amazing, @AlphonsoDavies 🙌 pic.twitter.com/Gh48fQZGrx— Major League Soccer (@MLS) July 29, 2018    Putting the Bayern deal to rest and rejoining the Whitecaps, he said, “was a weight off my shoulders after all the travel and meetings.” After a slow start — “the first 20 [minutes were] as bad as I’ve seen him play,” Coach Carl Robinson said — Davies hit his stride. “Another bit of magic,” Robinson said of Davies’s second goal. Davies is making gains on the senior international level as well, making six appearances since he became a naturalized citizen in early 2017 and scoring three goals in Canada’s first two matches at the Concacaf Gold Cup last summer. He was the youngest in tournament history to score, was named the best young player in the event and made the Best XI squad. Canada hasn’t qualified for the World Cup since 1986 and has produced few world-class players. Calgary’s Owen Hargreaves, signed by Bayern Munich in 1999, is an exception, though he opted to play for England on the international level. In Davies, however, the country has a brighter future. “We know he is a wonderful talent,” Robinson said. “We know he’s got ability. He’s got potential, but when he keeps playing like that, that’s not potential — that’s reality.” More on soccer: Wayne Rooney scores first MLS goal as D.C.

United’s 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rapids on Saturday with his first MLS goal, a broken nose and a gash over his left eye that sent blood pouring down his face and later required five stitches. United brought the English superstar to Washington to score goals and turn its fortunes on and off the field. In his first start at the new venue, wearing the captain’s armband, Rooney also showed he has no intention of coasting into retirement. Defending a corner kick in stoppage time, Rooney mixed it up with Axel Sjoberg, Colorado’s 6-foot-7 center back, and took a blow to the head. As he received medical treatment on the sideline, he stole glances of the action as his shorthanded team clinched three points before a crowd of 18,931.

He is a pretty tough guy,” said Coach Ben Olsen, whose dress shirt had been stained with blood after embracing his star forward. “It shows you what this means to him right now. He’s in the box, putting his face on the line, understanding that’s a big moment. We needed that play to get out of that spot.” [Wayne Rooney named D.C. United captain after three MLS matches] Rooney, whose acquisition last month was the priciest in United history, will continue to undergo evaluation. His status for next Saturday’s match at Montreal is unclear. Well before the injury, Rooney had provided the lead by slotting an angled shot between goalkeeper Tim Howard’s legs. He also hit the post in the second half and mixed well with Luciano Acosta, Yamil Asad and Zoltan Stieber in creating danger throughout the night. United failed to put the result out of reach and, after conceding the 82nd-minute equalizer, went ahead in the 90th on an own goal. Ulises Segura, a late sub who this past week returned from a knee injury, crossed from the end line in hope of making something happen. The ball caromed off Colorado’s Niki Jackson and past Howard. [Darren Mattocks is having a career year. The problem? He’s not Wayne Rooney] “It’s never luck,” Segura, a Costa Rican midfielder, said through an interpreter. “Whenever you get in the box like that, you try to hit it as hard as you can. So it either hits one of your teammates or hits a defender and you get something out of it.” Olsen admired his team’s resiliency, saying “to come back and find a goal – okay, it’s a little fortunate – I am very proud of them.” With a third match in eight days and his team struggling to earn points, Olsen shook up the lineup. Kofi Opare and Russell Canouse, both sidelined much of the year with injuries, made their first starts and Junior Moreno was in the lineup for the first time since early June. Canouse, who had been terrific as a sub for three matches, was a force in central midfield for United (4-9-5). “He’s physical. He’s relentless and he’s a fighter,” Olsen said. “It was nice to have that out there tonight because at times we have missed that.” Rooney’s return to the lineup, at the expense of eight-goal scorer Darren Mattocks, was expected all along after he started last weekend at Atlanta and came off the bench in Wednesday’s 1-0 defeat to the New York Red Bulls.   Wayne Rooney opens his MLS account! #DCvCOL https://t.co/XuKvh1sVea— Major League Soccer (@MLS) July 29, 2018    United set the terms in the first half, but thanks to a suspect call, Colorado (4-12-5) had the first genuine opportunity with a 26th-minute penalty kick. With a challenge from behind on Edgar Castillo, Moreno might have nicked the outside back’s heel. Castillo went airborne. Referee Ramy Touchen was convinced. The video assistant referee did not intervene. Acosta, a U.S. national team midfielder acquired last week from Dallas, stung the penalty kick off the right post. After the scare, United returned to form and went ahead on a well-crafted goal. Moreno won a tackle in the center circle. Stieber linked with Luciano Acosta, who spotted Rooney making a run and supplied a fine ball into the box. Rooney let the ball do the work, using a clever sidestep to put defender Tommy Smith off-balance. As Howard came off his line, Rooney used his first touch to place an angled, eight-yard bid between the charging goalkeeper’s legs. Rooney and Howard had been Manchester United teammates for two\\xa0years and Premier League opponents for 10 before Howard moved to MLS in 2016. United was the better side for most of the night but couldn’t expand the lead. In a three-minute span early in the second half, D.C. had three prime opportunities to extend the lead: Acosta’s cheeky footwork led to a tight-angled shot over Howard and off the top of the crossbar; Howard made a hand save on Rooney’s threat, pushing it off the back post; and Rooney’s heavy touch in the box allowed Howard to smother the ball before a shot attempt. United’s inability to score again came back to haunt it when Jack McBean played a diagonal ball to Kellyn Acosta blazing into the box on the right side. David Ousted charged off his line, but Acosta chipped it over both the goalkeeper and leaping defender Steve Birnbaum. United was crestfallen, a disappointing draw seemingly inevitable. But a hopeful cross reversed its fortunes again and provided a badly needed three points. “For confidence and morale, a win was important,” Opare said. “The results haven’t been great, but we believe in each other. And to bounce back from their goal shows the character of this group.” United notes: Midfielder Paul Arriola served a one-game suspension for yellow-card accumulation. … D.C. will visit the Montreal Impact next weekend before returning home Aug. 12 to face Orlando City.

(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)  Darren Mattocks is enjoying the most productive season in his seven-year pro career — and the campaign is only half over. In his first summer in Washington, the Jamaican forward shares D.C. United’s scoring lead with eight goals, an average of one every other appearance, and has helped lift an attack that last seas matched the MLS record for scoreless games. Mattocks, however, plays the same position as Wayne Rooney, the English superstar who arrived this month to bolster the organization both on and off the field. As Ben Olsen said, “We didn’t get Wayne to come off the bench for 15-20 minutes.” [Rooney named United’s team captain after three matches in MLS] And so the coach has had to strike a tricky balance of integrating Rooney while providing enough minutes to Mattocks to sustain both his production and spirit. “It’s a work in progress, if I am being honest,” Mattocks said Friday. “It’s not perfect. That’s pretty much all I can say.” Before Rooney’s arrival, Mattocks started 12 matches, entered as a sub once and did not play once while compiling all of his goals, including five in a recent six-game stretch for last-place United (3-9-5). Since Rooney’s arrival, he has not scored in two starts (in which he gave way to Rooney shortly after intermission) or as a second-half sub for his new teammate. Rooney is likely to start Saturday against the Colorado Rapids at Audi Field and, as his fitness level continues to grow, he is almost certain to become Olsen’s first choice in a system designed for one striker only. “It’s not an easy situation for Darren. I feel for him,” Olsen said. “However, this is professional soccer and he is going to have to do the best he can with the situation. .\\u2009.\\u2009.\\xa0It’s a tough adjustment. There is only so much I can say to him because in a lot of ways it isn’t fair.” Mattocks vented a bit Wednesday after leaving the field in the 57th minute, noticeably frustrated by the early removal. “He doesn’t want to be subbed. I understand his frustration, and some of it is warranted,” Olsen said. “But this is our new reality: How you deal with the circumstances is the important thing. I trust Darren’s character. He is a team guy and ultimately wants what is best for himself but for this team. There is enough of a foundation between us and in him to deal with this in the right way.” In talking about the situation Friday, Mattocks seemed to carry a mix of disappointment and understanding. “If you are looking long term, it’s going to affect my output if I get less playing time,” he said. “The more I play, the more I score. The first half of the season, I’ve been doing it. With Wayne coming in, overall it’s good for the team, but maybe I am going to be affected the most. “It’s tough to keep everyone happy in this situation. You have got to understand the business aspect of it — what he brings to the table — but at the same time, it doesn’t keep everyone happy. For the team’s sake, you have to put the team first.” Beyond the goals, Olsen has admired Mattocks’s attitude and work rate. “He’s a lovely guy,” Olsen said. “The way he has come in here and helped us in the goal department, but also he has worked harder than he has ever worked in his career. He has given us everything he has had and we expect him to continue to do it.” Even if he does lose the starting job, Mattocks will remain in Olsen’s plans. Rooney is on the back end of his career and won’t play 90 minutes every game, especially when United faces three matches in a week (as the team will have to do four more times). Olsen said his message to Mattocks is: “Take advantage of those minutes, so you can make my life difficult and lean toward putting you on with Wayne. Make it so I can’t keep you out of the lineup.” Olsen will stick with his one-forward alignment for the time being but has not ruled out a change that would partner Mattocks and Rooney on the front line or put Mattocks up front and Rooney in a withdrawn position. “Right now, I don’t think we’re there,” he said of a possible new formation. “We’re still trending in the right direction [in creating opportunities]. We have to see how this looks before we make any adjustments.” As for Rooney’s position, “We haven’t come to a conclusion yet where Wayne is going to play permanently for this team.” Olsen then added, “but the reality is, he is going to play.” United notes: D.C. remains in the market for defensive help, especially on the corners, before the transfer and trade window closes Aug. 8, Olsen said. .\\u2009.\\u2009.

(Annie Rice/AP)  CHICAGO — Before DJ Durkin discussed the upcoming season, a brewing quarterback competition and the benefit of recruiting local talent, the Maryland coach squinted into a row of bright lights, held both sides of a glass lectern and addressed what is heavily weighing on his football program as a new campaign nears. “Good to be here this morning. Good to see everyone. Marks the start of a new season. Great day. Appreciate you being here,” Durkin said to start his opening remarks at Big Ten media days Tuesday. Then he took a deep breath, arched his eyebrows and spoke a little softer than before. “I’d like for us to talk about the upcoming season, but just take a moment to share some thoughts on Jordan McNair and what he meant to our program, the type of teammate he was,” Durkin continued, referencing the Maryland offensive lineman who died June 13, two weeks after he was hospitalized following an organized team workout. “Obviously the loss of Jordan has been a tremendously difficult thing for our entire program to deal with this summer.” Durkin stood in front of a couple hundred reporters inside a Marriott conference room in downtown Chicago. Next will come the Terrapins’ first day of training camp at the end of next week, then their season opener against Texas at FedEx Field on Sept. 1, then their home opener two weeks later. All of that, like Tuesday, will carry the sadness and unease of McNair’s death. [Scott Frost is ready to get Nebraska ‘back where it belongs’] Earlier this month, McNair’s family announced that the 19-year-old lineman’s death was caused by heatstroke. They have also hired the law firm that represented the family of Freddie Gray, the Baltimore man who died in 2015 after being injured while in police custody, and are exploring their legal options. Durkin, who was at the workout with the rest of the Maryland coaching staff, declined to provide further details of that day while Maryland is still participating in an external review. The external review opened in the third week of June and could last 60 more days, according to a timeline provided by a university spokeswoman when it began. The review is being conducted by Walters Inc., an athletic training consulting firm. In addition to looking into McNair’s death, the review is evaluating\\xa0the football program’s procedures and protocols related to “planning and conducting team conditioning and practice sessions; and for responding to health emergencies during or after those sessions.” Durkin said Tuesday that he and Terrapins coaches and players have not yet been interviewed as part of the review but that Walters Inc. has made a list of people with whom to speak. Durkin did say that Maryland has already made adjustments in response to what led to McNair’s hospitalization May 29. “There’s things that we immediately put into place and looked at,” Durkin said Tuesday. “And then obviously through our external review there will be things long-term-wise that we’ll continue to change and adapt to.” “Just being more cognizant of all the things we are doing with our guys,” he said when asked what specific changes have been made so far. “Being aware of their hydration levels, being aware of communicating out on the field, all those things we’ve looked at and we made adjustments already with that. We’ll continue to make adjustments.” Maryland has offered a loose timeline of the day McNair was hospitalized and said the workout was designed and supervised by the team’s strength and conditioning staff. The university has also noted that athletic trainers were present throughout. The workout began at about 4:15 p.m. with the temperature around 80 degrees, according to the university. An initial 911 call was made at 5:57, according to an incident report written by Prince George’s County medical responders and obtained by The Washington Post through a public records request. That call, made by an unidentified man, indicated that McNair was “hyperventilating,” and the university has said McNair had trouble recovering from a conditioning test consisting of a series of 110-yard sprints. Medical responders arrived five minutes after the initial call. A second call at 6:07 p.m. indicated that McNair might have been having a seizure, a known symptom of heatstroke. McNair arrived at Washington Adventist Hospital in nearby Takoma Park at 6:36 p.m. and was airlifted to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore that night. He died 15 days later. “It’s definitely tough going into camp with what happened to Jordan,” Maryland offensive tackle Derwin Gray said Tuesday. “I don’t really want to get too detailed into what happened and things like that, but Jordan was a great guy. Jordan was a big guy with a big heart, and he loved to smile. He came to work every day, never complained, and I feel like he left a great message to us without even saying it: Hang around your teammates. Smile. Enjoy what you do together. “And most importantly, whether it’s a coach to a player, or player to player, or coach to coach, just telling each other, ‘I love you.’ Because you never know with this game we’re playing, anything can happen. So that’s what I take from the situation.” Now the Maryland football team\\xa0is deciding how to best honor McNair this season, and Durkin said Tuesday that a group of players is leading that discussion. “Jordan and his family will always be part of what we do,” Durkin said. “We’ve assigned a player committee to head that up and make sure that there’s always a presence. We’re a team playing for Jordan this year. So there will be some things we’ll announce in the coming days as we get into the season of what exactly we’re going to do and how we’re going to handle that.” More college sports coverage from The Post: UNC’s Larry Fedora, who questioned football’s link with CTE, finds backers at Fox Sports and Yahoo Brewer: Fedora’s defensive crouch is as dangerous to football’s future as concussions At ACC media days, Louisville football addresses latest scandal involving athletic department ', 'Maryland football coach addresses Jordan McNair death at Big Ten media days - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/terrapins-insider/wp/2018/07/16/heatstroke-caused-death-of-maryland-offensive-lineman-jordan-mcnair-his-family-announces/': ('by Jesse Dougherty July 16 Email the author       Maryland offensive lineman Jordan McNair died last month from heatstroke suffered during an organized team workout May 29, his family wrote on a website launched for a foundation they have started in his honor.

The school is participating in an external review of the situation conducted by Walters Inc., an athletic training consulting firm. The review is evaluating Maryland’s procedures and protocols related to McNair’s death. It is also evaluating the football program’s procedures and protocols related to “planning and conducting team conditioning and practice sessions; and for responding to health emergencies during or after those sessions,” according to a university spokesman. The review started at the end of the third week in June, and a university spokeswoman said then that it could require up to 90 days. The Jordan McNair Foundation, started by McNair’s parents, Tonya Wilson and Martin McNair, aims to “promote awareness, educate, and advocate for parents and student athletes about heat-related illnesses at youth, high school, and collegiate levels,” according to the “Our Mission” page of the website. The site includes an essay written by Martin McNair titled, “Jordan’s Journey: A Letter From a Father.” “Our plans did not include his death. Our plans included something more. Our plans included him,” Martin McNair wrote after detailing his son’s path to becoming a highly sought-after Division I football recruit out of Randallstown, Md., and eventually an offensive lineman for the Terrapins. “But God had other plans. Jordan gave us 19 great years, and we will miss him. He was a great son, grandson, cousin, nephew, brother, friend, student, roommate and teammate.” “While Jordan is not with us to build his legacy, as a family we are doing it for him. This is his legacy,” Martin McNair continued in the essay. “We ask but one thing, that you join us in keeping Jordan’s name and legacy alive by supporting The Jordan McNair Foundation (T.J.M.F.).” McNair was hospitalized following a team workout May 29 at the program’s outdoor practice facility. The workout was designed and supervised by the Maryland strength and conditioning staff, and certified athletic trainers were present throughout, according to an account provided by the university. Maryland Coach DJ Durkin was also at the workout, which began around 4:15 p.m. McNair, who was listed as 6-foot-4 and 325 pounds, had trouble recovering after completing a series of 110-yard sprints, a standard conditioning test, and received medical attention. McNair soon was transported to the team’s practice facility and later airlifted to\\xa0R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore at approximately 6 p.m., according to the university’s timeline of that day. He received a liver transplant, according to a GoFundMe page created June 6 to support his family. He died 15 days after he was initially hospitalized. The foundation’s website lists three programs: “Breaking Chains/the Jordan McNair Training Facility,” “The Jordan McNair Scholarship Fund,” and “My Body, My Safety: Player Safety 101.” The third program is looking to educate athletes, parents and coaches on heat-related illnesses in a handful of ways. One way is to “Educate students on heat-related illnesses and the stages of heatstroke.” Another is to “Partner with medical professionals to educate student athletes about their bodies and how to know when enough is enough.” Read more Maryland coverage: Many questions remain unanswered in death of Maryland player Jordan McNair Maryland basketball subpoenaed in college basketball corruption probe Damon Evans takes over as Maryland athletic director after two-month search led back to him Maryland Athletic Director Damon Evans will make $720,000 a year, before bonuses ', 'Heatstroke caused death of Maryland offensive lineman Jordan McNair, his family announces - The Washington Post'), 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/terrapins-insider/wp/2018/07/13/maryland-athletic-director-damon-evans-will-make-720000-a-year-before-bonuses/': ('Damon Evans at his introductory news conference on June 26.

The higher Maryland finishes in the final standings, the more money Evans can make as a result: $25,000 if Maryland ranks between first and fifth; $15,000 if it ranks between sixth and 10th; $10,000 if it ranks between 11th and 20th; and $5,000 if it ranks between 21st and 30th. Lastly, Evans will make an additional $5,000 at the end of each year Maryland has 10 or more teams play in NCAA-sanctioned postseason competition. If Evans were terminated without cause before June 30, 2019 (the end of the first year of his contract), Maryland would face a $5 million buyout. If he were terminated without cause on July 1, 2019, or anytime thereafter, he will continue to collect his base salary for the remainder of his initial contract term. Evans resigned as the athletic director at the University of Georgia in July of 2010 following a DUI arrest. Maryland is hoping Evans is a stabilizing presence in a trying time for the athletic department. Evans was Maryland’s interim athletic director after Kevin Anderson went on sabbatical last October, and was officially named full-time athletic director eight months later, in part because he is familiar with the challenges that lie ahead. The university is conducting an external review following the June 13 death of sophomore football player Jordan McNair, who was hospitalized following an organized team workout on May 29.

The review includes an independent evaluation, conducted by the athletic training consulting firm Walters Inc., of Maryland’s “planning and conducting team conditioning and practice sessions; and for responding to health emergencies during or after those sessions.” The university also recently released two subpoenas it received from a federal grand jury in New York in conjunction with the Department of Justice’s probe into college basketball.

      "{'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/campaign-text-messages.html': ('Marla Hohner was at home in Dallas when a text message arrived from an unfamiliar number.“Hi Marla,” it read. “This is Nate volunteering w/ Beto For Texas. Beto O’Rourke is running for Senate to represent Texans statewide, not special interest megadonors. And unlike Ted Cruz, Beto doesn’t take any money from PACs. Can we count on your vote?”Ms. Hohner, a senior adviser for a financial firm, was puzzled. She had heard of Mr. O’Rourke, a Democrat running against Mr. Cruz in November. But she had never volunteered for his campaign, given him money or agreed to be contacted by his volunteers.“It felt like a real invasion,” she said. “My first reaction was, who is this? How do they know my name? And how did they get my cellphone number?”Welcome to the age of the political mass-text. Candidates in this year’s midterm elections are still sending mailers, putting ads on TV and knocking on doors to drum up support. But they’ve added a new, hard-to-ignore tool to their arsenal: personalized text messages sent to voters’ phones.In a mobile-first age when TV ads are skipped and email inboxes automatically filter out junk and promotions, it’s not surprising that campaigns are desperate for a tool that can reliably get voters’ attention. What is surprising is how influential the lowly SMS text message, a tool that was invented during the elder President George Bush’s administration, has remained.This year, as social media platforms like Facebook lure political advertisers with the promise of microtargeted ads, old-fashioned texting has had an unlikely resurgence. Both Democratic and Republican campaigns are relying on mass-texting apps that take advantage of a clever legal loophole to send huge numbers of texts per day without running afoul of anti-spam laws.“There’s no question that texting is the breakout tech of 2018,” said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist and founder of Learn Test Optimize, a newsletter about political marketing. “There’s so much competition in the inbox, we’re looking for other channels. For now, that’s text messaging.”Mr. Wilson recently gathered a group of political strategists in a Washington office to talk, over dumplings and craft beers, about the sunny prospects for text messaging. The group agreed that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter were becoming crowded, and that text messages, which are read at higher rates than emails and are less invasive than phone calls, were a promising alternative.“Texting is just a humane, better, higher-engaged channel,” said Gerrit Lansing, a former chief digital officer of the Republican National Committee and co-founder of Opn Sesame, a texting app used by Republican campaigns.“I don’t know anyone under 45 who wants to be called,” Mr. Lansing said.Text messages aren’t new in politics. In 2008, Barack Obama announced he was picking Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. as his vice-presidential candidate with a text to supporters of his campaign. In 2016, both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump used text messages to raise money, promote local events and get voters to the polls.But this year’s campaigns swear by a new breed of “peer-to-peer” texting apps that allow them to carry on thousands of individual text conversations, keep track of replies and answer questions from voters in real time. The phone numbers often come from political groups that sell or share voter data to campaigns.Automated bulk text messages — the kind sent by pharmacies and airlines — are strictly regulated. Users are required to opt in to receive them, and organizations can be fined for sending unsolicited messages.Peer-to-peer texts appear to be unregulated because they are sent individually. Even if a program automates the process of choosing a recipient and filling a message with canned text, a human user has to press send on each message.“It’s not a blast communication,” said Caitlin Mitchell, the chief mobilization officer for the Democratic National Committee, which is using peer-to-peer texting in hundreds of campaigns this fall. “It lets you have a genuine two-way conversation with voters.”In May, the P2P Alliance, a trade group representing peer-to-peer texting apps, asked the Federal Communications Commission to clarify that the services were not subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, a law that prohibits using automated dialing systems to contact mobile phone users without permission. Peer-to-peer texting, the group wrote, is “an exciting technology that facilitates real-time communications that consumers want and expect.”A spokeswoman for the commission said it had not decided on the issue, and would seek public comment first.Peer-to-peer texting broke onto the national scene in 2016 when Senator Bernie Sanders used it to organize volunteers during the Democratic primary, and Democrats in particular seem to be racing ahead with their plans to use the technology.Volunteers for Stacey Abrams, a Democrat running for governor of Georgia this year, have sent more than 1.2 million text messages. Senator Doug Jones, the Democrat who prevailed in last year’s special election in Alabama, set up “texting banks” that sent 1.4 million texts to voters during that race. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose long-shot primary campaign defeated Representative Joseph Crowley, a 10-term incumbent in New York, used the texting app Relay to help drive voters to the polls.Roddy Lindsay, the chief executive of Hustle, a start-up that helps organizations use peer-to-peer texting, said the texting method “gets back to the heart of what campaigns do, which is talking to people and winning hearts and minds.”Victoria Nadel, a volunteer for Mr. Jones’s campaign last year, used the Hustle app to reach Alabama voters, reminding them to vote and where their nearest polling place was. Hustle automatically supplied each text message with a name and a number. All she had to do was hit send — which she did, hundreds of times a day.“It’s the best tool right now for getting out the vote,” Ms. Nadel said.Text messages are not free — most peer-to-peer platforms charge 10 to 30 cents per conversation, with discounts for large clients — but they are less expensive than printed mailers and appear to be more effective than other communication methods. Hustle, which is used by many Democratic campaigns as well as groups like Planned Parenthood and the Sierra Club, says texts sent through its platform receive responses at twice the rate of phone calls, and 36 times the rate of emails. Opn Sesame says 90 percent of text messages are opened within five minutes.All this texting seems to translate to dollars and votes. According to internal tests done by the Democratic National Committee, voters who received text messages through Hustle as well as printed mailers donated to campaigns at an 8 percent higher rate than voters who received only mailers. And campaign officials said voters who received texts on Election Day were more likely to show up at the polls.“We saw an increase in turnout amongst the communities we reached out via text message during the primary election,” said Priyanka Matha, who runs communications for Ms. Abrams’s campaign in Georgia.Of course, texting could also be used for more nefarious purposes. This month, voters in Tennessee reported receiving text messages that attacked two Republican candidates for governor, Randy Boyd and Bill Lee. The sender of these messages is unknown, and it is unclear whether these messages came from a peer-to-peer texting app or were sent another way.And not everyone appreciates the conversations. One Twitter user in Georgia posted a screenshot of a message she had received from a volunteer for Ms. Abrams’s campaign, asking if the campaign could count on her vote in November.“When hell freezes over!” the voter wrote back. “Lose my number!”Cain Rodriguez, 29, a theater artist in Dallas, said he had gotten dozens of text messages from Mr. O’Rourke’s Senate campaign. The messages were annoying, but he admitted they were probably effective.“I understand why it’s an important tool for them,” Mr. Rodriguez said. “You can’t ignore a text message.”', 'Campaigns Enter Texting Era With a Plea: Will U Vote 4 Me 🙏 ? - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/china-google-censored-search-engine.html': ('HONG KONG — Google withdrew from China eight years ago to protest the country’s censorship and online hacking. Now, the internet giant is working on a censored search engine for China that will filter websites and search terms that are blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.Google has teams of engineers working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the project. The company has demonstrated the service to Chinese government officials, they added.Yet the existence of the project does not mean that Google’s return to China is imminent, the people cautioned. Google often builds and tests different services that never become publicly available.Google’s reversal in China, which was reported earlier by The Intercept, is the latest example of how American tech companies are trying to tailor their products to enter the huge Chinese market, even if it means tamping down free speech. LinkedIn censors content in China, for example. And Facebook  developed software to suppress certain posts from appearing on the social network, with the aim of potentially deploying it in China, though there was no indication it was offered to Chinese authorities.Many of these overtures appear to fall short of winning over Beijing. Last month, Facebook briefly gained approval to open a subsidiary in China’s Zhejiang Province, but that approval was abruptly withdrawn after a matter of hours.Google’s work on a censored search engine for China has already caused an outcry among human rights activists. Many are concerned that the company would block a long list of foreign websites including Facebook, Twitter and The New York Times, as well as Chinese search queries including the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and information about the Chinese leadership.Amnesty International said it would be a “dark day for internet freedom” and would constitute “a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom” if the tech giant accepted China’s censorship terms.The work is also unpopular among many of Google’s own employees, who have pushed back in recent months on issues such as gender in the workplace and how artificial intelligence should be applied to weaponry. On Wednesday, several expressed their disappointment about the China project on internal messaging platforms, according to four employees who saw the messages and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.One internal posting that was viewed by The New York Times said that some employees who were asked to work on the project had declined to do so, opting to transfer to different work or to quit the company. Some employees said the work was a violation of Google’s previous statements about its stance on Chinese censorship, as well as its recently established principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence, which state that technologies should not be used to contravene human rights.“We provide a number of mobile apps in China, such as Google Translate and Files Go, help Chinese developers, and have made significant investments in Chinese companies like JD.com,” said Taj Meadows, a Google spokesman. “But we don’t comment on speculation about future plans.”Although Google pulled its search engine out of China in 2010, the company has lately displayed more interest in regaining access to the world’s largest internet population. In June, Google announced a $550 million investment in the Chinese online retailer JD.com. Last year, Google unveiled plans to open a research center in China focused on artificial intelligence. And the company has released translation and file management apps for the Chinese market. Google now has more than 700 employees in China.In the years since Google’s exit, local competitors have risen up, including China’s dominant search engine, Baidu. Beyond search, the vast majority of Google’s services, including its app store, email service and YouTube, remain inaccessible behind the Great Firewall, as the country’s system of internet controls is known.Talks between Google and the Chinese government over the censored search engine began before the start of the recent trade war between the United States and China, one of the people said. The talks were not going well, this person added.But the Chinese government could nonetheless use Google as a chip in its negotiations with the American government, which has been critical of the way China limits market access for United States technology companies. By letting Google’s search engine back into China, the Chinese government could give President Trump a political victory, earning some good will.For Google, China is an increasingly difficult market to navigate. The Chinese government has tightened internet censorship significantly since President Xi Jinping came into power five years ago. Companies need a great deal of resources to meet the censorship demands imposed by the government, and failing to do so can be serious. In the first half of 2018, China’s national internet regulator shut down or revoked the license of more than 3,000 websites.Google is a household brand in much of the world, but its name may draw blank stares from China’s younger generation who are growing up in the post-Google Chinese internet. Winning these people will be an uphill battle for Google, especially if it cannot differentiate itself much from Baidu.On Chinese social media on Wednesday, some people cheered the news of Google’s possible China re-entry, saying that they welcomed competition with Baidu, which has faced scandals over its search results related to medical treatment.Others questioned whether a heavily censored Google might be useful.“We welcome a normal Google but not a neutered Google,” said Liu Xingliang, head of research at the Beijing-based analytics firm Data Center of the China Internet. “We don’t need a second Baidu.”', 'For a Return to China, Google Is Said to Build a Censored Search Engine - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/personaltech/autoplay-video-fight-them.html': ('The web is in a dark place, as I plan to examine in the next several columns. If you need proof, look no further than autoplay videos, the first example.You’re probably familiar with this horrendous experience: You are perusing a website, and suddenly an annoying voice or unfamiliar music blasts through your speakers. You wonder, where is this coming from? You scroll up and down the webpage only to realize that a video is playing without your consent. And the noise polluting your ears is coming from an ad preceding a video you had never clicked to watch.Autoplay videos are all over the web and inside apps. They are prominent in your Facebook and Instagram feeds. Some major news sites embed them into features and news articles. Nobody seems to likes autoplay videos — not even people I’ve talked to in the ad industry. The indiscreet videos demand your attention while burning through your mobile data plan and sucking up your batteries. Yet they have become a necessary evil for many media publishers trying to survive in the digital age.“I think we’ve ended up in a really crappy user experience right now with video advertising,” said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted television ads. “Video has been pushed into every user experience whether or not it fits, because it’s a way to make more money.”Well, I come here bearing some good news and bad news about these abominations. The bad news is that autoplay videos are here to stay, and that the tools to combat them are far from perfect. The good news is that they are evolving to be less annoying, and that some sites let you turn them off. Here’s what you need to know about how we got here, what you can do and where autoplay videos are heading.In digital media, video advertising was always the ultimate goal. Twenty years ago, web publishers dreamed of delivering video ads online: It was the perfect format, already proved by the TV industry to be engaging to audiences and a big revenue generator. “Sight, sound and motion can make people laugh, make people cry, make them hug somebody,” Mr. Morgan said. “It can make them love a brand. It can make them whistle a brand’s theme song when they’re walking a dog.”Yet publishers faced technical hurdles, like slow internet connections, that made video ads untenable. Instead, publishers served ads that were static images, which eventually evolved to become graphics with some animations and sound. Over the last decade, fast wired and wireless connections spread, as did computers and smartphones. Consumers also became acclimated to streaming video services like Netflix and YouTube. Serving an online video became easy. So advertising firms like BrightRoll and Tremor Video, along with tech companies like Facebook, began testing video ads.Once they got started, there was no turning back. Video ads generated 20 to 50 times more revenue than traditional display ads, and the best way to get money was to make the videos play automatically, Mr. Morgan said. Tech platforms like Facebook and Twitter liked autoplay videos, too, because they were effective at getting people to stick around on their sites, said Taylor Wiegert, a director of user experience strategy for the Martin Agency. Automatically playing videos went from a rarity a decade ago to a prominent online advertising medium today.Many consumers have complained that autoplay videos are a nuisance. (I am one of them!) So tech companies have come up with some workarounds:■ Facebook and Twitter each offer the ability to prevent videos from automatically playing in their apps and websites. On Facebook, the instructions are buried in its Accessibility page, and on the Twitter website, the controls are found in the Settings menu, under Content. ■ On Instagram, you cannot disable videos from automatically playing. However, in the cellular data setting, you can configure the app to use less mobile data, which makes videos load more slowly when you are on a cellular connection. ■ Google’s Chrome browser prevents some videos from automatically playing. The web browser allows videos to autoplay on 1,000 sites where Google has determined that people have the highest likelihood of wanting to play videos with sound. Over time, after Chrome studies the websites that you visit, the browser adapts to allow autoplaying on sites where you frequently played videos with the sound on and disables autoplay on sites where you do not. ■ Some software developers offer browser add-ons that prevent all videos from automatically playing. But the tools are imperfect: A Chrome add-on that I tested, for example, blocked videos when I was doing a videoconference on Google Hangouts.As annoying as they may be, autoplay videos are here to stay — largely because the ads generate so much money. But they are thankfully becoming less obnoxious.Increasingly, advertising firms are shifting toward making autoplay videos with the assumption that people have muted their devices. Mr. Wiegert of the Martin Agency said his firm primarily makes ads with sound off by default. It designs them to communicate a company’s branding and message without requiring sound. Tech companies, too, are evolving their products to make autoplay videos less of a nuisance. For example, Google says that part of its criteria for allowing autoplay to work in the Chrome browser is for the videos to be muted or have no sound. And on Instagram, automatically played videos are muted by default unless you manually turn on the audio. “Autoplay with sound on is just going to go extinct,” Mr. Wiegert said. “It’s been deemed as a poor quality experience for users. Even I’ve gotten annoyed when I’ve been on a webpage and all of a sudden I hear sound coming through my speakers.”Yet Mr. Morgan of Simulmedia believes video ads will be forced to change more radically to give people fuller control over what they see. That’s because autoplay videos still satisfy publishers, not the consumers. “We’re putting those ads in those places because we can — not because it is the best for the user,” he said.', 'Autoplay Videos Are Not Going Away. Here’s How to Fight Them. - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/big-tech-earnings-stumbles.html': ('You may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.Over the last two years, lawmakers and the public around the globe have been awakened to fears about the expanding powers of the largest technology companies, particularly the ones I’ve called the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, the most valuable companies on the American markets.The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.In different ways, the companies have conceded some of these fears and have vowed to address them. Taking stock, cleaning up, admitting “moral responsibility” for their contributions to society — these are the buzzwords of a tech ecosystem that is supposedly subsumed by remorse and committed to rehabilitation.Yet there is something deeply incongruous at the heart of the supposed “techlash”: It is not really making a huge dent in the tech giants’ financial performance. Over the last two weeks, each of the five reported earnings that were brimming with mostly fantastic news for its investors. Amazon, which has long conditioned shareholders to expect a lot of growth but not much earnings, reported a record profit. Microsoft and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, both handily beat Wall Street’s projections. On Tuesday, so did Apple; if its price jumps as a result, it could become the first company to reach a market valuation of more than $1 trillion.Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?In a strange way, the social network’s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That’s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.“This is one of the most profitable business models I’ve ever seen, and that really hasn’t changed,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook’s stock now “may be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.”Together the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren’t having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon’s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they’ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That’s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon’s servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon’s site.For rival retailers, Amazon’s new profitability constitutes a kind of nightmare scenario. By shuttling profits from software into its retail business, Amazon can keep expanding its store at a breakneck pace.“These high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin — and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,” said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.But it’s not just Amazon that’s profiting under the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen’s thesis that “software is eating the world.” Microsoft’s surging earnings were also driven by its cloud business, while Apple’s software services — things like sales of apps, music subscriptions, cloud storage and Apple Pay — are the fastest-growing part of its business.The European Union recently fined Google $5.1 billion for abusing its mobile software monopoly, which followed a $2.7 billion fine last year for abuse of its search monopoly. (Google is appealing both decisions.) Apple agreed last year to pay nearly $16 billion in back taxes to the European Union over its cozy tax deal with Ireland. (The funds will be held in escrow while Ireland appeals the decision; Apple has disputed any wrongdoing.) Facebook, which has been hauled before lawmakers in Europe and the United States for its role in politics, faces threats of increased regulation and possible fines for mishandling private data.But Big Tech’s earnings so far don’t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe’s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook’s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.There is also the possibility that regulatory zeal will abate. Google watchers say it’s notable that President Trump tweeted criticism of the European Union’s fine against Google, suggesting, perhaps, that American regulators won’t take up a similar case. (Of course, it is hard these days to really know how much to read into a presidential tweet.)Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon’s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook — which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government’s help.“There’s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,” Mr. Mahaney said. “Now it’s going to be a triopoly — but if you were worried about the duopoly, you’re probably saying, ‘Couldn’t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?’”Finally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the “green fields” — the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties — Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them — are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there’s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.And that’s just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.“The one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,” Mr. Squali said. “They see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they’re not afraid to destroy something that’s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.”In other words: Get used to the Five. They’re not going anywhere.', 'Stumbles? What Stumbles? Big Tech Is as Strong as Ever - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/personaltech/israel-gaza-google-translate.html': ('How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? David M. Halbfinger, bureau chief for The Times in Jerusalem, discussed the tech he’s using.You travel into Gaza and the West Bank for your reporting. What tech gadgets and apps do you use on assignment in those areas?My electronic gear is fairly simple. I carry two iPhones, each with an Apple case that doubles the phone’s battery life (I’m not that happy with these because they disintegrate after about a year, but I haven’t shopped around); a MacBook Pro; battery backups; Bluetooth headsets, keyboard and mouse; and a small bag jammed full of cables, plugs and cigarette-lighter adapters.I sometimes also carry an Iridium satellite phone, and I always travel with a power strip in case there aren’t enough outlets where I am. I try to keep my backpack light in Gaza. Other items — armor-plated flak jacket, Kevlar helmet, gas mask and spare filters, and a trauma kit — add lots of weight to my load.Probably the most vital tech tool I carry is the lightest: a paper clip to switch SIM cards. I’ve been here less than a year and finally got a local number from the Palestinian provider Jawwal, which has good coverage across Gaza and can be quickly replenished at countless retail shops. For months I was managing with Israeli cell service near the border and a New York number that had decent coverage in Gaza City over the Wataniya network. But now I juggle the Gaza and New York phones depending on which has the stronger signal.What tech tools do you use to navigate the language barrier in Hebrew and Arabic?I depend way too heavily on Google Translate, both for work and in my personal life. For accurate translations I rely on an excellent support staff, but in scanning social media I routinely turn to automated translations — far more than I’d like.My wife and I feel like captives of Google Translate in making sense of Hebrew-language messages on local WhatsApp groups, bank statements, utility bills and so on, but it is adequate, and it continues to improve — in particular through its camera interface. As iPhone, not Android, users, we look forward to the day when WhatsApp will let us translate within the app, rather than copying and pasting into the Translate app.In part because of the confusion of the language barrier, but also because of the complexity of the beat, I record more phone calls in this job than I have in other assignments. TapeACall Pro makes that as simple as making a three-way call, and produces a recording seconds after I hang up. I also use TurboScan to send documents from my phone, and CamCard to scan the business cards of new contacts.What about just plain navigating?To get around in Gaza, I work with an experienced driver, but in Israel and the West Bank I drive myself using a combination of Waze and Google Maps.Waze is excellent in Israel, where it was invented. Almost everyone uses it, vastly enhancing the quality of real-time traffic information. But it is pretty much useless in Palestinian territory: If you plug in a location in Ramallah, it will warn you that your destination “is in a high risk area or is prohibited to Israelis by law,” and then take you to the point on the map where you cross into Palestinian-controlled territory, but no farther. Google Maps at least will navigate you all the way to your destination, but its routes often don’t account for one-way streets going the wrong way.A bigger problem in getting around in Gaza and the West Bank is the dearth of Western-style street addresses. Many streets have no names, let alone house numbers. The most reliable way to get somewhere is to have someone at that location share the map coordinates and then get there with Google Maps, allowing extra time for wrong turns. Maps.me, a crowdsourced app that allows you to download maps and use them without cell service, also looks promising.Waze is great at flagging radar traps, speed cameras and traffic jams, and my kids took over the voice prompts, so I hear them giving me turn-by-turn directions. What none of these apps has yet mastered, though, is the ability to pinpoint the location of the creeping student drivers who seem to clog traffic on every block of my neighborhood in Jerusalem. There needs to be an app for that.What steps do you take to secure your communications given the often sensitive nature of your reporting?I use WhatsApp more and more, in part because of the encryption, but also because it’s simple, it’s fast, and it makes it easy to set up ad hoc groups for specific assignments or places. I also regularly share my location on WhatsApp with a security adviser and a couple of other colleagues in case anyone needs to retrace my steps. For particularly sensitive communications, I use Signal.How do Israelis use tech differently than people in the United States?Americans don’t have to worry about rockets being fired from Canada or Mexico. But Israelis who live near Gaza or in the Golan Heights need to know the instant that the military detects incoming rockets; as a rule, civilians have about 15 seconds to get to a bomb shelter. Several apps, including one in English — called, simply, Red Alert — instantly convey alerts about incoming fire to users based on their locations. I get alerted to all of them.More innocuously, I’ve used parking meter apps in the United States, but none of them was as easy to use as Pango — and that’s saying something, since it only works in Hebrew and I have to translate the alerts it sends me. It bills me once a month, it doesn’t charge me when it shouldn’t, and it usually knows when I have driven away from my parking spot but forgotten to turn off the meter.And I also can’t live without Gett, which is basically Uber but for taxis, and is also available in London, Moscow and other places.

She was the unknown Long Island teen plucked from a Cold Stone Creamery and cast as the star of the 2007 movie musical “Hairspray.” Now, a decade after that big splash, her acting career has slowed to a drip. Recently she lent her voice to “Pup Star,” a direct-to-digital entry in the “Air Bud” extended universe. Soon she’ll appear in a horror movie opposite Gary Busey’s son. But lately Ms. Blonsky has found a new performance platform: Cameo, a service that allows fans to pay low- to midrange celebrities to send them short, personalized video messages. Ms. Blonsky is the bard of Cameo. She excels at the projection of intimacy. She takes a few spare details about her subject — an upcoming birthday, a career milestone — and spins them into a sugar-voiced pep talk filmed as a dim, shaky selfie. The heady mix of heartfelt emoting and janky video quality creates the illusion of a bridged gap between celebrity and fan. The experience costs $20. I bought one for myself:Cameo is an intriguing new development in celebrity-fan relations. Commoners have always had a tenuous relationship with the stars. Their images and life stories exert a strong gravitational pull over our own, and the internet has provided the opportunity for the masses to yank back. Attempting to assert control in the confines of celebrity culture can take the form of fanatical image monitoring (as is the case with celebrity Photoshop-obsessed communities like Pretty Ugly Little Liar); creepy body fixations (indexing and cataloging celebrity parts on sites like WikiFeet and CelebHeights.com); erotic fan fiction (where you can write your favorite star into any scenario you choose); and criminal invasions (hacking and trading nude images).Cameo offers something new. It’s a kind of celebrity ventriloquism — the opportunity to project your voice through a famous host. It’s the “Being John Malkovich” of apps.Here’s how it works: Browse an array of available Cameo “talent” — the list includes “The O.C.” star Mischa Barton (current rate: $75), the N.F.L. Hall-of-Famer Terrell Owens ($350), the former boybander Lance Bass ($125) and a raft of “Real Housewives” socialites — and choose your favorite player. Then type in some credit card information and a set of instructions. The dummy copy reads: “My buddy Shia (pronounced SHY-UH) is graduating from college on Saturday (my name is Jason). Played football with him for three years, loves all your content. Our favorite saying is ‘okay pal?’. Please wish him a happy graduation.” If the celebrity accepts the request, a video will materialize in your inbox within a week. If he or she doesn’t, you’ll receive a sad GIF and won’t be charged. Cameo “talent” is free to reject any request found “confusing, difficult, or not in line with an athlete’s or influencer’s image,” so the potential thrill of being recognized by a B-list celebrity always comes with the risk of being rebuffed by one.Steven Galanis, a former LinkedIn account executive who is C.E.O. of Cameo, realized a couple years ago that “the celebrity selfie is the new autograph” and set out to democratize the experience with the help of co-founders Devon Townsend, a former Microsoft engineer, and Martin Blencowe, a producer and N.F.L. agent. Now, you no longer need to hope for a random celebrity run-in to secure such an image; you can pay Cameo to engineer it for you.But Mr. Galanis’s even-more-valuable intuition was this: Famous people are willing to do a lot more for money than was previously assumed. Mr. Galanis recalled asking the New York Knicks player Lance Thomas, a friend of his from college, how much it would cost for him to make an appearance at a Long Island bar mitzvah, and he replied, “Bro, I’ll go anywhere for $2,000.” Mr. Galanis did the math: Maybe three hours at the event, plus one hour of travel each way, amounted to about six dollars a minute. But boil an “appearance” down to just the few minutes is takes to shoot a video, and such experiences could be made available on a wide scale — “the greatest gift ever, and cheaper than a ticket to a Knicks game,” Mr. Galanis said. Mr. Thomas is now a Cameo investor and on its talent roster. Along the way, Cameo has unwittingly created a new style of performance. Some practitioners are more skilled than others. Occasionally, requested messages enter the celebrity’s brain and come out garbled. Others just seem insincere. Even a “bad” Cameo offers something of value, which is a totally new way of analyzing a celebrity persona. Dina Lohan, best known for giving birth to Lindsay, has struggled to adapt to the form. In her Cameos, she regularly appears perched in a striped armchair next to an enormous silk curtain contraption, filmed from across the room by an unseen handler. Her messages come off as scripted and rote, which, of course, they are. She has received such feedback from users as “She said 31st birthday instead of 35th” and “She doesn’t seem to be having fun.” But there’s also something wonderful about receiving a text message containing an artifact like this. It’s like a direct injection of her arid momager essence.A few celebrities appear to be using Cameo as a one-on-one image rehabilitation service. When I requested a Cameo from Jon Gosselin of “Jon & Kate Plus Eight,” he made sure to casually drop this: “I’m so busy I had to do it from my car.” $40. Rebecca Black, who rose to infamy as an awkward teenager in 2011, when a low-budget music video for her puzzling and atonal single, “Friday” went viral, has re-emerged on Cameo, where she seems to have found her calling. Now 21, she is suddenly gorgeous and self-assured. In her videos, she appears winkingly gracious to her “fans” for listening to “Friday,” then performs a twee ukulele version. Her voice sounds amazing. $30.One of the most intriguing aspects of Cameo is not the videos but the site itself, where famous people from every corner of modern celebrity — music, sports, YouTube, reality TV, viral infamy — assign a dollar amount to their self-worth. Celebrities set their own rates; Cameo takes a 25 percent cut. The real-life “Wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort has offered himself up for $1,000. Mr. Owens once charged $500 but has since dropped his rate to $350. The model Adriana Lima (who has the same name as a Victoria's Secret model) costs $40. Lee Garrett, a former “Bachelorette” contestant perhaps best known for his racist comments, goes for $5. In addition to soliciting Cameos from Ms. Blonsky and Mr. Gosselin, I bought videos from the celebrity gossip Perez Hilton, the youth culture queen Bella Thorne and Ms. Lohan. Because I am a sadist, I asked them to say “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.” They mostly did, and now I feel strangely tender toward them all. Except for Ms. Lohan. Instead of repeating the tongue twister, she sat in her chair, told “me,” I guess, that she had just returned from opening Lohan Beach Clubs in Greece, and wished my family “love, laughter, and great health.” She didn’t say my name. $75. \", 'Now You Can Just Pay Celebrities to Say Stuff - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/personaltech/mac-find-lost-files.html': ('Q.

Names, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses were among the identifiable details that were leaked.Under Armour revealed a data breach in March of 150 million accounts on its food and nutrition app MyFitnessPal; the genealogy site MyHeritage announced one in June affecting 92 million users, and 340 million individual records held by the marketing firm Exactis were exposed that month on a publicly accessible server.In one of the most jaw-dropping cases, Yahoo last year updated figures to reveal that an attack in 2013 had affected all three billion of its user accounts, up from a previous estimate of one billion.Experts caution that the stream of news about such breaches can set a new normal and instill a sense of fatalism — and complacency — in consumers.Anthony Vance, an associate professor and director of the Center for Cybersecurity at the Fox School of Business at Temple University, said last year’s breach of information held by the credit reporting company Equifax, which affected 145 million Americans, was “a game-changer.”The information gleaned could be used to fraudulently open new credit accounts, he said, adding, “That should give even the most jaded American consumer pause and prompt them to do something.”But evidence suggests that high-profile breaches don’t typically change consumers’ behavior.A Pew Research Center study found most Americans keep track of their passwords by memorizing or writing them down, with only 12 percent using a password manager, which can generate hard-to-crack passwords.A RAND Corporation report in 2016 said only 4 percent of people started using password managers after being notified that their data was exposed in a breach, Mr. Vance said.And an experiment conducted by Mr. Vance and other researchers found a disconnect between consumers’ professed concerns about online security and their actions. In the experiment, people using their personal computers to complete an assigned task tended to ignore warnings that some sites they were about to visit were not secure.He said consumers may be told the same advice repeatedly but are slow to respond unless they’ve already had a bad experience. Only then does this “once bitten, twice shy” lesson sink in.“You’re not going to back up data, no matter what I tell you, until you lose the baby pictures of your first child,” Mr. Vance said. “Sometimes it takes an incident to internalize behavior. It’s so easy to get inured.”Experts call this behavior “breach fatigue.”Steven Andrés, who teaches at the Fowler College of Business and homeland security program at San Diego State University, said it would be reasonable to think consumers would be more diligent after heavily publicized breaches, but some research indicates just the opposite.“We may adjust to this being the ‘new normal,’” he said, adding that “digital natives and younger generations may perceive their personal data — in a distorted sense — to never have been private, so what’s the big deal with it leaking out on the web anyway?”A “recency bias” leads consumers to believe that as a breach recedes in the headlines, it becomes less threatening, Mr. Vance said. However, the data in the Equifax breach does not have a half-life and could be used for nefarious purposes at any point.Blame human nature.Anticipated danger can easily be “deflected, deferred or declined” because it makes us feel anxious and stressed, said James Norrie, dean of the Graham School of Business at York College of Pennsylvania and a cybersecurity expert.People also tend to have unrealistically optimistic outlooks about future events and believe that bad things will happen to someone else, experts said.“There’s not going to be a magic bullet,” said Vinny Troia, chief executive and principal security consultant of Night Lion Security and an expert in network security. “It’s the same things we’ve been saying over and over again.”Consumers will be best served if they heed this familiar advice: Don’t reuse passwords, rely on two-factor verification, install software only from trusted sources, question any alert that pops up on your screen and get a password manager.“We are not living in a bubble per se, but instead we are underestimating the security of our data,” said Gilbert E. Franco, an assistant professor of psychology at Beacon College in Leesburg, Fla. “Much like a teenager underestimates the risks they take, we as a society are still in our adolescent years when it comes to the internet.”', 'Data Breaches Keep Happening.

It lost $3.06 per share on an adjusted basis, excluding stock compensation — more than analysts had expected. The company’s cash balance fell to $2.2 billion, with the net decrease narrowing to $436 million, from $745 million in the first quarter.Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, has repeatedly forecast that Tesla will generate profits in the third and fourth quarters of this year, and the company said Wednesday that it still expected to achieve that goal. Tesla warned, though, of “negative pressures” from higher import duties on Chinese components — a consequence of President Trump’s trade battle with China.On one of its most closely watched metrics — production of the mass-market Model 3 — the company reported gains. In late June, Tesla passed a key milestone, producing 5,000 of the vehicles in a week — the benchmark it has said it needs for sustainable profitability. In July, Tesla maintained that production pace “multiple times,” the company said Wednesday.“A total vehicle output of 7,000 vehicles per week, or 350,000 per year, should enable Tesla to become sustainably profitable for the first time in our history,” the company said Wednesday in a note to investors.Tesla’s stock rose nearly 5 percent in extended trading, after closing Wednesday at $300.84.The company recently said that Model 3 production in the quarter surpassed the combined production of its higher-priced Model S luxury sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles for the first time. Tesla once spoke of selling the base version of the Model 3 for $35,000, but it is currently taking orders only for versions that start at $49,000.Tesla’s ambitions — its stated corporate mission is “to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy” — are expensive, and its financial safety net is dwindling, prompting some analysts to predict that it will soon need to raise more money from investors. The company has never had a profitable year and has incurred $10 billion in debt.In June, Tesla, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., laid off 3,500 employees, around 9 percent of its work force, to reduce its operating costs. It recently made the unusual move of asking some suppliers for price reductions on work already underway.The amount that Tesla owed its suppliers ballooned in the second quarter, which may have helped the company conserve its cash during the quarter. Its accounts payable, the balance sheet item for yet-to-be-paid bills, totaled $3 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of more than $425 million from the first quarter.But its big bets keep growing. Last month, Tesla announced plans for a vast new plant in China, its first outside the United States, that it hopes will eventually make 500,000 vehicles a year.Analysts will have a chance on Wednesday to quiz Tesla executives on a conference call. Last quarter’s call became heated, as Mr. Musk refused to answer what he called “boring, bone-headed questions” and suggested that those who do not believe in the company’s long-term vision should “please sell our stock and don’t buy it.”', 'Tesla, With Gains in Model 3 Output, Says Profit Is Imminent - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/facebook-security-alex-stamos.html': ('SAN FRANCISCO — When Facebook revealed on Tuesday that it had identified a political influence campaign ahead of the November midterm elections, the company’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, was front-and-center in speaking on the issue.But Mr. Stamos will exit the social network this month, just as Facebook steps up its efforts to combat misinformation and foreign interference. In an interview, Mr. Stamos, 39, said he planned to join Stanford University in September as an adjunct professor and will also become part of a faculty working group called Information Warfare where he will examine the role of security and technology in society.The timing is tricky as Facebook grapples with potential threats including election meddling and hackers. The New York Times reported in March that Mr. Stamos planned to leave Facebook in August and that his day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others last December, but the Silicon Valley company does not plan to appoint a successor for chief security officer.In an internal Facebook post from January written by Mr. Stamos, which was obtained by The Times, he said the company’s security team was being reorganized and would no longer operate as a stand-alone entity. Instead, he wrote, Facebook’s security workers would be more closely aligned with the product and engineering teams and focus either on protecting the company’s corporate infrastructure or its users.“The safety and security challenges we face today are dispersed across many surfaces, and addressing them requires the focus of many teams across the company,” Mr. Stamos wrote in the post.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said in a statement on Wednesday that Facebook would continue to collaborate with Mr. Stamos in his new job at Stanford.“Alex has played an important role in how we approach security challenges and helped us build relationships with partners so we can better address the threats we face,” she said.Amy Zegart, the co-director of Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation, said in a statement that Mr. Stamos had been working with the Stanford cyberpolicy program for several years and had piloted a “hack lab” class this past spring.Mr. Stamos’ departure is part of several executive exits from the social network, which has been hit by scandals including Russian meddling on the platform in the 2016 presidential election and misuse of people’s data. The Times reported that Mr. Stamos was leaving Facebook after he had advocated the company to disclose more about Russian election interference last year but was met with resistance.Mr. Stamos said in the interview that his last day at Facebook would be Aug. 17. At Stanford, he said, he planned to study the upcoming midterms and the role of technology, as well as election security more broadly and the topic of disinformation. He said he would also look at subjects as basic as passwords and try to reimagine how they could be made more secure.Mr. Stamos also said Information Warfare was a new working group at Stanford with about 14 faculty members across academic disciplines. The group, which will begin meeting this fall, plans to research information warfare tactics and to develop countermeasures. Mr. Stamos said he planned to teach a class for law and policy students on how hackers attack, with the goal of familiarizing future policymakers with common hacking techniques.Of his time at Facebook, he said, “Obviously, it has been a difficult three years. I’d like to take the things I’ve learned and apply them more broadly.”Mr. Stamos previously worked as chief information security officer at Yahoo before joining Facebook in 2015. He has been vocal about cybersecurity issues. For example, in an address last year at Black Hat, a cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas, he argued that security professionals were overly focused on solving problems that were complex or bizarre and had lost sight of the everyday problems that plagued the internet.Mr. Stamos said that over the course of his career, he had worked as a consultant for all of the major tech companies in Silicon Valley. That would help in his new role at Stanford, he said.“Part of my goal is to help people find the right folks at these companies, to come up with structures in which we can have cross-disciplinary academic study,” he said, adding that he wanted to address issues including online child safety and the naming of a country or group responsible for a cyberattack.“There aren’t good norms around a lot these things yet,” Mr. Stamos said.', 'Facebook’s Security Chief to Depart for Stanford University - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/what-is-qanon.html': ('Those watching President Trump’s rally in Tampa on Tuesday couldn’t help but be exposed to a fringe movement that discusses several loosely connected and vaguely defined — and baseless — conspiracy theories.In one shot on Fox News, the president was partially obscured by a sign in the crowd reading “We Are Q.” In another shot during the president’s speech, a sign promoting the debunked Seth Rich conspiracy theory, with the hashtag #Qanon, came into focus in the center of the screen. Some attendees wore T-shirts with a blocky Q. Others held up signs with the letter. They were all self-described “followers of Q,” an anonymous person or group of people who claim to be privy to government secrets. That supposedly classified information has been revealed on the 4chan and 8chan message boards and spread around mainstream internet platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Q has attracted people — the exact number is hard to know — eager to consume his “bread crumbs,” or new details in a sprawling web of conspiracy theories.What is going on? Here is the short version: Q claims to be a government insider exposing an entrenched, international bureaucracy that is secretly plotting all sorts of nefarious schemes against the Trump administration and its supporters. The character uses lingo that implies that he or she has a military or intelligence background. It’s a stew of various, but connecting, conspiracy theories that generally hold Mr. Trump as a conquistador battling a cabal of anti-American saboteurs who have taken over government, industry, media and various other institutions of public life in a plan to … well, the overarching goals of the nefarious actors are not clear.A growing group of people (more on the scale and scope of that community below) are coalescing around a collection of theories and half-thoughts that they believe reveal an untold story of current world events. To decode what they believe is actually happening, followers of Q sift through the president’s tweets, government data sets or news articles. Ben Decker, a research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, described followers of the QAnon narrative as “an interactive conspiracy community.”Sometimes followers of Q just look for signs that he exists. A popular Rosetta Stone they use is to look for uses of the number 17 (the letter Q’s placement in the alphabet). So when Alabama’s football team presented Mr. Trump with a jersey with the number 17, it was taken as coded signaling of Q’s influence. (The team was visiting the White House as the champions of the 2017 college football season and had presented President Barack Obama with a jersey bearing the number 15 when it visited after winning a championship in 2015.)Q’s followers ascribe secret coordination and hidden motives to an endless parade of politicians, journalists, and leaders of industry and other institutions. Often, their theories are wildly at odds with reality.The community uses the language of mind-bending pop culture alternate realities like “The Matrix” or “Alice in Wonderland.” It is common to tell stories of how followers have been “redpilled,” or have come to believe that observable reality is false and the QAnon narrative is real. The shared rush to interpret clues from a “drop” of information from Q resembles something close to what video gamers call an MMO, or massive multiplayer online game. Because QAnon is not limited to a fringe corner of the internet. In addition to its front-and-center presence at Mr. Trump’s rally, it has been promoted by celebrities including Roseanne Barr and Curt Schilling, the former baseball star who has a podcast for Breitbart. The paranoid worldview has crossed over from the internet into the real world several times in recent months. On more than one occasion, people believed to be followers of QAnon have shown up — sometimes with weapons — in places that the character told them were somehow connected to anti-Trump conspiracies. “The biggest danger is you are one mentally unstable person away from the next massive incident that defines whatever happens next,” Mr. Decker said. “The next Pizzagate, which for better or worse did define the political conversation for a while.”In June, a man armed with a rifle and a handgun drove an armored vehicle to the Hoover Dam on what he said was a mission from QAnon: to demand that the government release the Justice Department’s report from its inspector general on the conduct of F.B.I. agents during the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. The report had actually been released the day before, but Q’s followers believed there was a secret, second report that contained far more damning information about the F.B.I. There is no indication that such a report exists. The man was arrested after a standoff with the police.Most recently, a suspicious and possibly armed man showed up at the law offices of Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the adult film performer known as Stormy Daniels, after Q posted a link to Mr. Avenatti’s website and a picture of the office building. The man did not enter the premises.In an interview, Mr. Avenatti said he had received a large number of threatening emails and social media posts in recent months, “but this one we have significant reason to believe posed a significant threat.” He said local law enforcement was investigating the incident. “I do think it is dangerous, absolutely,” Mr. Avenatti said. “And I think it is incumbent upon the president to quash this nonsense as opposed to feeding it.”Mr. Decker said the prominence of QAnon T-shirts and signs at Mr. Trump’s televised rally in Tampa, and the elevation of that imagery via cable news coverage of the rally, were troubling. “In a sense, the internet won,” he said.“These are communities craving attention, they’re craving media appearances, they’re craving exposure so they can further propagate,” he said. “It is very concerning to exponentially increase the audience of this content to eight-, nine- or 10-figure populations.”The /r/GreatAwakening subreddit board vibrantly shares memes with 49,000 followers, making it a medium-size board. There are Facebook groups, one of the most popular of which has nearly 40,000 members sharing hundreds of posts with one another a day. Video explainers of Q followers talking through potential connected topics have racked up millions of views on YouTube, and the numbers of tweets out there are too numerous to count (and the difficulty in discerning genuine posts versus bot activity makes Twitter a poor measuring stick anyway). But perhaps the greatest signal of the sustained, dedicated audience for this discussion can be found in the seismic traffic to websites and apps set up to collect and curate preferred 4chan posts about Q. In April 2018, an app called “QDrops” was among the 10 most downloaded paid iOS apps in the Apple Store, according to an NBC report that cited an analytics site. The Qanon.pub site was created in March 2018 and has quickly established an audience of over seven million visits a month, according to the web analytics company SimilarWeb.', 'What Is QAnon: Explaining the Internet Conspiracy Theory That Showed Up at a Trump Rally - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/technology/apple-earnings-report.html': ('Apple reported another strong quarter of profits on Tuesday, as consumers kept buying iPhones and paying more for them, news that could soon help make the Silicon Valley giant the first public company to be worth more than $1 trillion.Apple said its profit increased to $11.52 billion in its most recent quarter, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier, showing that the company’s enormous business selling iPhones and other gadgets continues to breeze along.The strong results beat Wall Street estimates, sending the company’s shares about 4 percent higher on Wednesday to a new record and for a market value of more than $950 billion.Apple’s ascent past $1 trillion in market value would further confirm a remarkable turnaround from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago. The steep growth was driven by a series of new products that upended the technology industry — and, in some cases, society — and that remain big sellers.Apple said it sold 41.3 million iPhones in the latest quarter, up less than 1 percent from a year earlier. But iPhone revenues rose 20 percent because Apple is getting customers to pay nearly 20 percent more for the devices on average, a trend driven by its flagship $1,000 iPhone X.“That’s a sign that the iPhone X, despite its high price, is resonating with consumers,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research.Apple is also offsetting some slowing growth of its hardware sales with an accelerating business charging customers for apps, data storage and other services. Revenue from those services grew 31 percent to $9.55 billion in the quarter, and Apple Music surpassed Spotify in the quarter as the most popular music-streaming service in North America, Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, suggested on the company’s earnings call.Total revenues in the quarter were $53.27 billion, up 17 percent from a year earlier.With the huge profits, Apple is sitting on $243.7 billion in cash, much of which it plans to return to investors. In April, it unveiled plans to buy back $100 billion in stock. On Tuesday, the company said it had returned $25 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $20 billion in share repurchases.Buying back so much stock helps keep its price high, rewarding investors. “They have so much cash and so much buying power, they can synthetically support the stock. So it’s very hard to bet against,” said Sander Read, chief executive of Lyons Wealth Management. His firm, an investment adviser near Orlando, Fla., has invested roughly $30 million of the $200 million it manages in Apple stock.Apple’s outlook does have challenges. Arguably no American company has a greater reliance on China for its success, and the growing trade war between the United States and China could threaten its high-flying business.Apple makes most of its products in China, which is also its third-largest sales market. Mr. Cook said Apple was evaluating a new round of proposed American tariffs on Chinese goods that could hit some Apple products, like the Apple Watch, “and we will be sharing our views of it with the administration.”Some Apple executive are also concerned that the tariffs could prompt Chinese officials to hamstring Apple’s business in China as retaliation, The The New York Times reported in June. “I can’t predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this,” Mr. Cook said.Apple said Tuesday that its revenue in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan had increased 19 percent to $9.55 billion, nearly the same rate of growth for its sales in the United States.', 'Apple Could Soon Be Worth $1 Trillion as Profits Pour In - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/technology/san-francisco-tech-free-lunch.html': ('SAN FRANCISCO — The corporate campuses of the Bay Area’s technology companies have become independent fiefs with dry cleaning, gyms, doctors, shuttle buses and bountiful free meals, made by the best chefs poached from the region’s famous restaurants. Now, local officials are knocking at the gates.And they are coming for the food.Two San Francisco supervisors introduced an ordinance last week that would forbid employee cafeterias in new corporate construction. It is not clear whether the measure will pass, but it is a direct attack on one of the modern tech industry’s most entrenched traditions.The ordinance, which seeks to force tech workers out of their subsidized cafeterias and into neighborhood restaurants, is the latest attempt by San Francisco leaders to make the tech companies that are migrating north from Silicon Valley adapt to life in the city.The issue is an emotional one in San Francisco, where the flood of new workers and existing residents have struggled to mesh as the cost of living has spiraled. Income inequality in the city — often defined as “the haves who work for tech companies versus just about everyone else” — is among the highest in the country. Renting a one-bedroom apartment now costs on average $3,258 a month. The median home price rose to $1.6 million earlier this year.Though San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors is not expected to consider the cafeteria ban until the fall, local reaction to it has fallen along the city’s typical, pro- and anti-tech fault lines.“These tech companies have decided to leave their suburban campuses because their employees want to be in the city, and yet the irony is, they come to the city and are creating isolated, walled-off campuses,” said Aaron Peskin, a city supervisor who is co-sponsoring the bill with Ahsha Safaí. “This is not against these folks, it’s for them. It’s to integrate them into the community.”Mr. Peskin’s ordinance is also aimed at getting more out of a tax deal given to tech companies that would agree to move into a troubled area called Mid-Market. In 2011, the companies were given tax breaks on payroll and stock options with the hope that they would bring jobs and investment to the neighborhood, just a short walk from San Francisco’s City Hall.Within a few years, a number of companies like Twitter, Square and Uber moved into Mid-Market. But despite initial excitement over the opening of a number of restaurants and shops, the neighborhood has not yet flourished the way many had hoped.Open drug use is still common on the streets around Twitter’s headquarters. Some of the big restaurants that moved in have already moved out because they were not drawing enough customers. A few stories up, in a forbidding Art Deco-style building, Twitter employees enjoy free meals in an expansive corporate cafeteria. Tight security on the ground floor keeps the problems of the street away.“We gave huge tax breaks to revitalize neighborhoods,” Mr. Peskin said. “But instead, they’re all walled into their tech palaces.”Existing tech kitchens would be grandfathered in under the proposed ordinance, so that anyone who has in-office meals now would keep them. But newcomers would have to learn to eat out or brown bag it.“I’m not taking away anybody’s lunch,” Mr. Peskin said.San Francisco is not alone in trying to crack the insularity of fast-growing tech employers. City officials in Mountain View barred Facebook from serving free meals at its new campus that opens this fall. Facebook is even planning on building residential housing for non-employees as it expands in nearby Menlo Park.Tech companies have long offered perks like free meals, mainly to keep employees in the office and working longer hours. High-end cafeterias often made sense when companies were in suburban office parks, surrounded by parking lots and not a whole lot of food options. But the social and commercial functions they now provide to their employees are unprecedented, said Leslie Berlin, project historian for the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford University.“There’s never been anything on the scale of what we’re seeing now,” said Ms. Berlin, who wrote a history of the industry called “Troublemakers.” “I’ve often wondered what’s lost in this trend to just constantly stay in your own ecosystem. What are the risks in these siloed monocultures?”To some tech workers, targeting their free food feels more like scapegoating for the city’s problems than like sound policy. San Francisco had drug and homelessness issues long before Twitter came along. Tech companies cannot be blamed for local policies that have helped to derail new housing construction. And not every computer programmer, they note, is a millionaire.“I’m not in favor of local government mandating where I can and cannot eat,” said James Manning, 43, the director of user experience at Dolby Laboratories, where in-office meals are heavily subsidized. “The idea the food doesn’t need to be subsidized, that tech workers make so much, is a fallacy. Tech workers, the vast majority, with the cost of living here, are not wealthy.”As he talked, Mr. Manning was having lunch (barbecue ribs) on a foray outside his office “as a treat” because he was meeting up with friends.“It’s the food equivalent of going out for drinks,” he said.Certainly, not all tech companies in San Francisco offer employees free meals. Salesforce, the largest tech employer in the city, does not. And Paul Rava, the chief financial officer at Credit Sesame, a start-up that offers free credit scores, said the cafeteria ban could help him compete for workers.“This could even the playing field a bit,” he said. He said his company had just recruited someone from Google, which is hard because it cannot match the food spread.Katherine Chiao, the co-owner of Kagawa-Ya Udon, a Japanese bistro that shares a building with the Uber and Square offices in Mid-Market, said the corporate cafeterias were making local restaurants “unsustainable.” Workers do not come downstairs to eat, she said.“All the restaurants that moved in here, we’re just sitting ducks,” Ms. Chiao said. “Who’s going to go down next?”In the center of Mid-Market, downstairs from Twitter, is a buzzing grocery store and food court called the Market. The food hall includes a poke bar, an organic chicken sandwich counter, a wine bar and a Malaysian restaurant. But it is hard to compete with free.Michael Cohen, the Market’s managing partner, said he visited some of the tech company cafeterias and was shocked to see people not only eating their free lunches — they were picking up a few things to eat at home.“They’re grabbing extra fruit, snacks, drinks, right out of the refrigerators,” he said. “I’m a lifelong grocer, and I saw people shopping.”Still, he offered as a caveat, the bigger issue for him is crime, street chaos and the staggering expense of security (there are several security guards at the door and inside). Recently, someone took off their pants in the store and had to be carried out by a guard, only to come back and urinate on a window.“I’ve operated grocery stores all over the country,” he said. “This environment is the most challenging I’ve ever been in.”Sitting outside the Market were two tech workers dressed in layers for the San Francisco summer chill, wearing corporate badges on drawstrings. Free food, they said, was more necessity than luxury.“I’d personally rather have the cash,” said Tim Bellay, 40, a software engineer at Microsoft, which has a local office.“If I have food upstairs, I’m not going to pay for it, no way,” said K. C. Clawson, 35, who does business analytics for Microsoft. “I’m so cheap.”What then do they spend their money on?“Rent,” Mr. Bellay said flatly.“Rent,” Ms. Clawson said. “There’s no other choice. Even on weekends. You know, I used to go out. I used to go out to restaurants all the time. I used to love it. Now in San Francisco, when I don’t eat at the office, I cook.”', 'San Francisco Officials to Tech Workers: Buy Your Lunch - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/us/politics/facebook-political-campaign-midterms.html': ('WASHINGTON — Facebook said on Tuesday that it had identified a political influence campaign that was potentially built to disrupt the midterm elections, with the company detecting and removing 32 pages and fake accounts that had engaged in activity around divisive social issues.The company did not definitively link the campaign to Russia. But Facebook officials said some of the tools and techniques used by the accounts were similar to those used by the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-linked group that was at the center of an indictment this year alleging interference in the 2016 presidential election.Facebook said it had discovered coordinated activity around issues like a sequel to last year’s deadly “Unite the Right” white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Activity was also detected around #AbolishICE, a left-wing campaign on social media that seeks to end the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.“At this point in our investigation, we do not have enough technical evidence to state definitively who is behind it,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy. “But we can say that these accounts engaged in some similar activity and have connected with known I.R.A accounts.”The jolting disclosure, delivered to lawmakers in private briefings on Capitol Hill this week and in a public Facebook post on Tuesday, underscored how behind-the-scenes interference in the November elections had begun.In recent weeks, there have been reports of other meddling, including a Daily Beast report that the office of Claire McCaskill of Missouri, one of the Senate’s most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election this fall, was unsuccessfully targeted by Russian hackers last year, which Ms. McCaskill confirmed. American intelligence officials have indicated that at least one other unnamed Democratic senator up for re-election has been targeted.Officials at Facebook, which is based in Silicon Valley, said they were working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence agencies on their discovery of the influence campaign. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, and other executives also mounted a media blitz to explain what the company did and did not know about the efforts.Those actions were a change from last year, when Facebook was widely criticized for failing to detect Russian interference in the 2016 election. It took Facebook executives months to acknowledge the extent of the Russian operation and release information connected with their investigation.Since then, Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have been under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators for other scandals, including data misuse, a misinformation epidemic and accusations of political bias. Last week, the company lost over $120 billion in market value as it projected it would spend more money on moderation and security.Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, did not directly address Facebook’s findings with reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, but he said President Trump had “made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference into our electoral process from any nation-state or other malicious actors.”Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Trump declared again on Twitter that there had been “No Collusion” between his campaign and the Russians, and asserted that, in any case, “collusion is not a crime.”Lawmakers from both parties quickly set aside questions of who had perpetrated the influence campaign and said Facebook’s disclosure only clarified what they had feared since the extent of Russian involvement in 2016 became clear more than a year ago: that social media companies would be unable to keep up with the pace and scope of malicious efforts to abuse their platforms.Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said he would make the disclosure a central part of a previously scheduled hearing on Wednesday, when lawmakers plan to press outside experts on the pervasiveness of foreign influence on social media networks like Facebook.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, praised Facebook on Tuesday for bringing the activity out into the public, but asked for its cooperation in updating laws to prevent influence campaigns.“Today’s disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow division and spread disinformation,” he said.Facebook executives characterized the battle with foreign campaigns as a cat-and-mouse game, but said they were making progress to detect suspicious activity more quickly.“Security is an arms race, and it’s never done,” Ms. Sandberg said in a conference call on Tuesday.Facebook said the recently purged accounts — eight Facebook pages, 17 Facebook profiles and seven Instagram accounts — were created between March 2017 and May 2018 and were first discovered two weeks ago. More than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the suspect pages, which had names like Aztlan Warriors, Black Elevation, Mindful Being and Resisters, the company said.Between April 2017 and June 2018, the accounts ran 150 ads costing $11,000 on the two platforms. They were paid for in American and Canadian dollars. The pages created roughly 30 events over a similar period, the largest of which attracted interest from 4,700 accounts.Finding suspicious activity was harder this time around, Facebook said. Unlike many of the alleged Russian trolls in 2016, who paid for Facebook ads in rubles and occasionally used Russian internet protocol addresses, these accounts used advanced security techniques to avoid detection. For instance, they disguised their internet traffic using virtual private networks and internet phone services, and used third parties to buy ads for them.“These bad actors have been more careful to cover their tracks, in part due to the actions we’ve taken to prevent abuse over the past year,” Mr. Gleicher said.But there were clues that the suspicious accounts may have been connected to the Internet Research Agency. Mr. Gleicher said an account known to be associated with the agency had been listed as an administrator of one of the pages for seven minutes.Like the 2016 Russian interference campaign, the recently detected campaign sought to amplify divisive social issues, including through organizing real-world events.Among the campaign’s efforts was organizing support for a counterprotest to a conservative rally. Specifically, an account called Resisters, which interacted with one Internet Research Agency account in 2017, created an Aug. 10 event, “No Unite the Right 2 — DC,” to counter a planned white supremacist rally in Washington on Aug. 11 and 12 by the same group that organized the racist march in Charlottesville one year earlier.Although other Facebook pages are promoting the counterprotest, the social network said that the Resisters page was the first, and that it had coordinated with administrators for five other apparently real pages to co-host its page — publicizing details about transportation and other logistics. A person familiar with the matter said the page was created on June 24.That event page has been taken down, and Facebook has notified roughly 2,600 users who had indicated interest in attending the event, and 600 more who planned to attend, about the suspicious activity behind it.Organizers of the counterprotest — who quickly created a new Facebook page — objected to Facebook’s suggestion that a fake account was behind the event itself and not just the creator of a Facebook event page for it.One organizer, Chelsea Manning, the former Army analyst who was convicted of sending archives of secret documents to WikiLeaks in 2010 and whose sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama in 2017, said the counterprotest was “real and organic.” She called Facebook’s implication that the Resisters account had started it misleading.“We started organizing several months ago,” Ms. Manning said. “Folks from D.C. and Charlottesville have been talking about this since at least February.”On Capitol Hill and in congressional races across the country, the #AbolishICE campaign has divided Democrats and provided Republicans with fodder to paint Democratic candidates as extremists who want open borders. The issue, Republicans hope, could help drive a wedge between liberal Democrats and the moderate voters the party needs to retake control in Washington. Mr. Trump has gone as far as encouraging Democratic candidates to embrace the campaign.“They’re going to get beaten so badly,” he said in early July.[How “Abolish ICE” went from social media to progressive candidates’ rallying cry.]After being caught flat-footed by the Internet Research Agency’s efforts ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Facebook has expanded its security team, hired counterterrorism experts and recruited workers with government security clearances.The company is using artificial intelligence and teams of human reviewers to detect automated accounts and suspicious election-related activity. It has also tried to make it harder for Russian-style influence campaigns to use covert Facebook ads to sway public opinion, by requiring political advertisers in the United States to register with a domestic mailing address and by making all political ads visible in a public database.Despite Facebook’s efforts, stopping coordinated influence campaigns has proved difficult. False news flourished before the Mexican elections in July, and the company has been cracking down on misinformation ahead of Brazil’s national elections in October.The American midterms, though, are a major test for the company, which is trying to show that it can handle its role as a global arbiter of conversation and commerce — even with interference by others.Earlier in July, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, warned that Russian interference remains an active threat to November’s elections.“The warning lights are blinking red again,” he said.', 'Facebook Identifies an Active Political Influence Campaign Using Fake Accounts - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/style/the-swimsuit-emoji.html': ('The Miss America pageant is not the only establishment rethinking the swimsuit portion of its offering. The Unicode Consortium — that is, the emoji overlords (or, more officially, the nonprofit organization “devoted to developing, maintaining, and promoting software internationalization standards and data”) — are in the process of deciding whether to allow a very simple pink maillot, or one-piece bathing suit, to join the itsy-bitsy-teeny-weeny-yellow-polka-dot bikini in the emoji lexicon. Its point is to offer another, less sexualized, option to users who may not feel that the Barbie-wardrobe two-piece really communicates who they are or what they want to say. Or is the most relevant choice in the current cultural climate.“I have nothing against bikinis,” said Florie Hutchinson, the 38-year-old independent arts publicist and mother of three (soon to be four) girls, who, along with Jennifer 8. Lee, a former New York Times reporter and the co-founder of Emojination, proposed the maillot addition. “I have worn them. But not every woman or girl wants to wear one, and they should have the ability to make another choice,” Ms. Hutchinson said. “I wanted my girls, when they got old enough to have their own smartphones, to be able to see both, side by side.” As it happens, she is also the woman who, a year ago, began the process of convincing the Consortium to add a flat shoe emoji to the red stiletto that already existed. Not every woman, it turns out, dreams of teetering around in skyscraper heels.That proposal became something of a feminist cause célèbre. “I was really surprised,” Ms. Hutchinson said. “I knew it meant something to me but hadn’t expected it to mean so much to so many.” The shoe was formally adopted earlier this year; it should appear in emoji lexicons everywhere this month or next. Having changed the women’s wardrobe options once, Ms. Hutchinson was ready to do it again. Ms. Lee, who has made it her mission to modernize the emoji vocabulary so that it reflects contemporary culture in an inclusive way, approached her about working together on the bathing suit, and Ms. Hutchinson enlisted Aphee Messer, the artist who created her shoe, to come up with a design.“We wanted something very basic so that it would read microscopically,” Ms. Hutchinson said. The style of the suit — thigh-cut legs, round neck — is more sporty than sexy, and the curves of the theoretical body beneath less Playboy than those implied by the bikini. The one-piece is designed to appeal to those for whom swimming, or the pool and the beach, is more about activity than, say, hooking up, or who identify with strength and functionality (or discretion) more than seduction.Also children.Ms. Hutchinson and Ms. Lee are not, as it happens, the only emoji users who have taken note of the limited bathing suit options available to those who like to send messages via pictograms. Still, not everyone is convinced. Now that the swimsuit emoji has been shortlisted for inclusion in the 2019 lexicon and is awaiting a verdict, Michael Everson and Andrew West, members of the International Organization for Standardization (and the two typographers who became famous for their campaign against last year’s frowning poop emoji), have expressed skepticism about the need for an additional swimsuit. “Why? Mr. Everson asked in a comment to the emoji subcommittee. “A person wanting to indicate the use of swimwear can’t use the existing BIKINI? Is this really necessary? What about a Victorian bathing costume? Or a wet suit? Or water wings?”“Do not encode,” was his recommendation. Mr. West simply wrote that he saw “no need.”Ms. Hutchinson said: “I was flabbergasted. It seemed like a very archaic response to me.” One that, she said, reflected the dominance of “male coders, male feedback providers, men who sit on the committee.”(It should be said that not every man involved with the subcommittee is against the swimsuit.)Ms. Lee wrote in an email: “One could say it’s simply a failure of “theory of mind” with regard to emoji: How could anyone want an emoji that ‘I’ find useless or redundant? But I think it’s a subtle sign of the dearth of empathy in part of society that is manifesting itself in other social fissures right now.”It’s also a relic of the early years of emojis, and the fact that, as she pointed out, “until 2016, the only roles you could play as a woman were princess, bride, dancer and Playboy bunny.” That has changed now. There are more than 2,500 different emojis currently available, with more being added each year, though the wardrobe options are still relatively limited and notably retrograde, especially for women. Of note: Up for inclusion in 2019, along with the maillot, is a sari. Still, there is a way to go, as both women are well aware. Ms. Lee mentions the poncho and the kurta as good future candidates. Ms. Hutchinson has another idea for an icon that could use a more modern option.“The coin purse!” she said, referring to the silk pouch with the gold closure that looks exactly like the sort of purse used a prop in old MGM movies. “It’s like something out of the 1920s. It drives me bonkers.” ', 'The Fight for the One-Piece Swimsuit Emoji - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/30/technology/robot-hands.html': ('', 'How Robot Hands Are Evolving to Do What Ours Can - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/technology/personaltech/apple-calendar-week-view.html': ('Q.

Big companies are generally domiciled in Delaware. And online poker companies often set up their bases in Gibraltar and Malta.Now the race is on to become the go-to destination for cryptocurrency companies that are looking for shelter from regulatory uncertainty in the United States and Asia.In small countries and territories including Bermuda, Malta, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein, officials have recently passed laws, or have legislation in the works, to make themselves more welcoming to cryptocurrency companies and projects. In Malta, the government passed three laws on July 4 so companies can easily issue new cryptocurrencies and trade existing ones. In Bermuda this year, the legislature passed a law that lets start-ups doing initial coin offerings apply to the minister of finance for speedy approval.“We are 65,000 people, and 20 square miles, but we have a very advanced economy,” the premier of Bermuda, E. David Burt, said in an interview at a cryptocurrency conference in May in New York, where he was trying to pitch companies on the island’s charms. “We want to position Bermuda as the incubator for this industry.”The competition for cryptocurrency companies is part of a broader rush by governments to figure out how to approach a new industry that took on outsize prominence over the last year. Becoming a crypto center has many potential upsides, including jobs and tax revenue.But the drive to be a crypto nexus also comes with significant risk. Hackings and scams have followed the industry everywhere it has gone. They have been aided by the underlying technology introduced by Bitcoin, known as the blockchain, which was built to make it possible to send money without requiring approval from government agencies or existing financial institutions. And the cryptocurrencies are hardly stable, with the prices of most having plunged in 2018 after skyrocketing last year.The use of cryptocurrencies by hackers was reinforced this month when the Justice Department announced charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee and said they had principally used Bitcoin to fund their work.Volatility and uncertainty have deterred some countries and caused others to hesitate in embracing crypto companies. In China, the government banned cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings after many of its citizens were swept up in the frenzy and bet their savings on digital tokens. And the Japanese authorities halted the operations of several crypto exchanges this year after one of the biggest licensed exchanges was hacked.In the United States, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, has warned that most companies that have raised money by selling cryptocurrencies have most likely not followed the law. But his agency has not provided clear guidance on the line demarcating legal and illegal projects.All of this has opened the door for smaller countries to provide a friendlier environment, separate from private efforts — such as in Puerto Rico — to create crypto havens. And many of the countries’ moves are already having an effect, with dozens of companies — including the largest exchange in the world — announcing plans to set up offices in the small jurisdictions that have passed laws.Bermuda has been a leading player. Apart from passing the law to allow for fast approval of initial coin offerings, the British territory has a law in the works to open the doors to cryptocurrency exchanges and related services. Mr. Burt said his government was modeling its approach on one it had taken with the insurance industry, in which Bermuda has become a major player.Bermuda’s measures have attracted Will McDonough, the founder of a new cryptocurrency called iCash. He said he had decided to base his company there because of the island’s experience in international finance and the government’s willingness to listen to the company’s input.“The largest issue blockchain companies have is not knowing how they’ll be governed or regulated,” said Mr. McDonough, a former vice president at Goldman Sachs. “Those markets that have made the rules clear have found many companies coming to play by the rules.”Mr. McDonough is planning to raise $35 million by selling iCash tokens to investors around the world, including some in the United States. The iCash tokens are initially designed to be the method of payment for an online gambling site. He said he would still be based in Florida, but would have an office and a head of operations in Bermuda, which the island requires of all companies.Other companies are playing the field more. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, went shopping for a new location after Japan shut it down this year for operating without a license. The exchange, which is known for its desire to skirt regulations, announced in March that it would open new offices in Malta with hundreds of employees as a result of the friendly laws the country had put into motion.That prompted Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, to post a congratulatory tweet and proclaim the island’s intention to be the “global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses.”But a month later, Binance’s chief executive, Zhao Changpeng, traveled to Bermuda to announce that the company would also open up compliance operations there and invest $15 million in the island. At the signing event with Mr. Burt, Mr. Zhao wore a tie and blue Bermuda shorts.Mr. Zhao did not respond to requests for comment.Many of the countries passing the new laws have said they are not interested in becoming a home for illicit activity. Albert Isola, Gibraltar’s finance minister, said his government was accustomed to making hard decisions after regulating online gambling companies for the last 25 years.“For every one license we’ve issued, we’ve probably said no to 10,” he said. “When you’re considering a new sector, to bring in big names is extremely attractive, but they’ve got to be good names. So you’ve got to be willing to say no to even some of the bigger ones.”Online gambling is responsible for around 3,000 jobs on Gibraltar, or about 10 percent of the territory’s population. Mr. Isola said he saw a similar possibility in the blockchain, calling it “the next significant new flow of business.”Gibraltar is in the final stages before voting on regulations that, similar to Malta’s, would let companies issue and trade digital tokens. Already, 35 companies have applied to the government for licenses to operate blockchain businesses.Liechtenstein, the Alpine nation between Austria and Switzerland, is also among the newer entrants to the race, with the prime minister circulating a Blockchain Act this summer to allow companies to sell tokens.The activity has spread to other areas, too. Wyoming and Delaware have passed laws aimed at welcoming certain blockchain businesses, though they have been less focused on ones that trade in tokens. In 2014, New York created a so-called BitLicense, which initially drew businesses to the state, but it has since been viewed as a deterrent because of the government’s wide-ranging requirements and slow approval process.In Switzerland, the canton of Zug has also sought out crypto business, labeling itself Crypto Valley. Zug’s top economic official who has worked on the effort, Guido Bulgheroni, flew to the cryptocurrency conference in May that Mr. Burt also attended.At a cocktail party for Crypto Valley, Mr. Bulgheroni said his first job was to make sure that anyone with a crypto project was happy being in the Zug area.“How many other jurisdictions have that?” he said.', 'Have a Cryptocurrency Company? Bermuda, Malta or Gibraltar Wants You - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/nyregion/uber-cap-civil-rights.html': ('As president of the New York Urban League, Arva Rice often relies on ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft to reach her home in Harlem after late-night events.“I have been passed up by yellow taxis on numerous occasions,” explained Ms. Rice, who is black. “When you live in Harlem or Bed-Stuy, getting home is harder than it should be.”Black and Latino New Yorkers — and those who live in the boroughs outside Manhattan — have long said they are not served well by yellow taxis. Now, a proposal by the City Council to place a one-year freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses is being opposed as a civil rights issue by organizations such as the National Urban League, the National Action Network and the N.A.A.C.P.“I’m trying to get to work, I’m trying to get to school — I want somebody that’s going to pick me up,” the Rev. Al Sharpton told an audience on Saturday at the Harlem headquarters of his organization, the National Action Network.“Some yellow cabs won’t even go uptown or to parts of Brooklyn,” Mr. Sharpton later said in an interview. “If you are downtown they won’t stop.”The package of proposed legislation from the Council, which could be voted on as soon as Aug. 8, would stop new for-hire vehicle licenses while the impact of their growing presence was studied. That could lead to a cap on the number of for-hire vehicles, which would be a first for a major American city.There are more than 100,000 for-hire vehicles in New York City, up from 63,000 in 2015, according to the city. More than 80,000 of them are associated with ride-hailing apps.The increase has led to congestion on city streets, according to a 2017 report, and contributed to the troubles of the yellow cab industry. The value of a yellow cab medallion — which is required to operate a taxi — has fallen precipitously since 2014, when the city last held a medallion auction. That year, one was selling for $900,000 to $1 million, according to data from the Taxi and Limousine Commission. In June, prices ranged from $165,000 to $700,000.There have also been six driver suicides in recent months, including a man who fatally shot himself outside City Hall, after writing a long post on Facebook about the dire effects of the competition.Other bills in front of the Council would set a minimum wage for drivers and authorize the taxi commission to study whether to set a minimum fare; create a new license for high-volume, for-hire vehicle services; and waive the licensing fee for wheelchair-accessible vehicles.“I understand the concerns about people of color being denied service, but I want to make clear that we are not diminishing service,” Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said. “The vehicles that are out there now will remain out there.”He added: “We are not saying Uber is bad. They have met a significant need. We are saying the industry needs to be regulated.”Mr. Johnson said the legislation would allow vehicles to be added to specific neighborhoods if the taxi commission determined that access to service was being hurt during the yearlong study. Wheelchair-accessible vehicles could also be added.Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents drivers of yellow cabs and for-hire vehicles, said it was important to discuss transportation in the context of civil rights.“Race-based refusal is a serious issue among yellow taxis and in the Uber and Lyft world,” Ms. Desai said. “But Uber and Lyft don’t have a supply problem, they have an efficiency problem.”For-hire drivers in the city, many of whom are nonwhite immigrants, are being hurt because the roads are oversaturated with vehicles, Ms. Desai said. Ride-hailing vehicles and yellow taxis were empty a third of the time while in Manhattan’s central business district, according to the 2017 report by Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official.“Defending the oversaturation which has resulted in the deep poverty of a work force made up of immigrants of color is not a civil rights position, it is the antithesis,” Ms. Desai said.This is the second time the city has sought to slow the growth of for-hire vehicles. Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed a cap on for-hire vehicles in 2015, but  the city backed down after Uber waged a public-relations campaign. Mr. de Blasio voiced support on Friday for the most recent proposal.Uber has started a social media campaign against the proposed license freeze, and this year created a website that emphasizes the number of trips “in areas long ignored by yellow taxis and where access to public transit is limited.”“We are growing fastest in the outer rings of the outer boroughs because we are serving communities that have been ignored by yellow taxis and taken for granted by the M.T.A.,” said Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Uber statistics, he said, show that ridership in neighborhoods such as East New York in Brooklyn and Kingsbridge in the Bronx had more than doubled since this time last year.Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Rice say their nonprofits have received donations from for-hire companies such as Uber and Lyft. The taxi industry has donated money to the campaigns of Mr. de Blasio and members of the City Council, including Rubén Díaz Sr., chairman of the Committee on For-Hire Vehicles.Mr. Johnson, who was against the 2015 push to cap the growth of for-hire vehicles, now says the concerns are too much to ignore.“What’s changed is the level of congestion, the explosive, unbridled growth of for-hire vehicles and the number of taxi drivers who have taken their lives,” Mr. Johnson said. “I’m for us figuring out a sound public policy solution.”Those assurances are not enough for those who oppose the plan.“This does not directly deal with the historic and current problem of yellow cabs’ bias of servicing us in our community,” Mr. Sharpton said.The Rev. Dr. Johnnie M. Green Jr., the pastor of Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem and president of a statewide clergy organization, said he recently had trouble getting a yellow taxi at La Guardia Airport to take him where he wanted after he had returned from Georgia.“It’s a racial issue,” Mr. Green said. “The people that champion the crusade against Uber do not have a problem hailing yellow cabs.”', 'Uber Gains Civil Rights Allies Against New York’s Proposed Freeze: ‘It’s a Racial Issue’ - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/world/europe/uk-facebook-fake-news.html': ('LONDON — A closely watched British parliamentary committee examining Russia’s exploitation of social media to try to influence elections has called for sweeping new regulations on tech companies, and has accused Facebook of providing “disingenuous answers” to some questions while avoiding others “to the point of obstruction.”A report from the House of Commons panel, which is investigating “fake news” on the internet, cited Facebook’s resistance to disclosing information as evidence of the need for more stringent rules to hold social media giants accountable for content.“Facebook should not be in a position of marking its own homework,” the committee said, in a report scheduled for release on Sunday, arguing that Facebook’s resistance to providing information to Parliament “does not bode well for future transparency.”The report is the latest indication that policymakers in Europe and North America are turning sharply more skeptical about the social media giants, once hailed as leaders of a revolution in free speech and human interaction.The panel — the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee — collaborated with the Senate Intelligence Committee in Washington, which on Friday announced that it would hold its own hearing in the coming week on foreign influence operations over social media.“The threat posed by this challenge is not just an American problem — it is one that confronts all free societies, and we need to work together to ensure we are protecting our democracy,” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate committee, said in an emailed statement.The report and hearing come at a delicate moment for Facebook’s business, as a string of recent scandals involving the spread of misinformation or misuse of personal data are starting to damage the company’s growth in users and advertising. Facebook disclosed on Wednesday that its growth had slowed while it faced rising costs to try to repair its credibility, and the news pushed its stock down about 20 percent by the next day — shaving $120 billion off the value of the company.Damian Collins, the chairman of the British parliamentary committee, said in a statement, “What we have discovered so far is the tip of the iceberg,” calling this “a watershed moment in terms of people realizing they themselves are the product, not just the user of a free service.”Facebook’s problems began to increase when American intelligence agencies concluded that Russians had used fake identities to spread propaganda over Facebook and other social media sites to try to influence the 2016 American presidential election.That revelation was part of the impetus for the formation of the British parliamentary committee, which sought to determine whether Russia had applied similar efforts to sway the 2016 referendum on Britain’s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit.Moscow has long sought to weaken the European Union, and the committee’s report cited research showing that in the six months before the referendum in June 2016, the Kremlin’s English-language outlets, Sputnik and Russia Today, published 261 articles supporting Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc. Those articles then somehow reached more users on Twitter than the content produced by the two main campaigns for Brexit.Yet the committee complained in its report that a lack of disclosure by the internet companies had thwarted its efforts to assess the extent of Russia’s potentially hidden efforts to use false identities or polarizing messages on social media sites to manipulate public opinion.“Time and again, Facebook chose to avoid answering our written and oral questions,” the report noted.“There has been a continual reluctance on the part of Facebook to conduct its own research on whether its organization has been used by Russia to influence others,” the report said, describing “a disconnect between the government’s expressed concerns about foreign interference in elections, and tech companies intractability in recognizing the issue.”Officials at Facebook and Twitter, who were not immediately available for comment, have said that they cooperated fully with the committees, suggesting that British intelligence agencies failed to provide the kind of information about fake Russian accounts that enabled the companies to disclose more about the American case.Most worrisome for the internet companies, however, are the committee’s recommendations to impose stricter regulations, disclosure requirements and penalties on the social media companies. The committee said the British government was expected to lay out proposals for a new regulation framework later this year. It not yet clear how much influence the committee’s recommendations may have on that process.European and American lawmakers have long treated the social media networks as passive platforms for content shared by users, and the laws have largely shielded the companies from liabilities for defamation, privacy violations, copyright infringement and other issues — protections that advocates for the companies say are essential to their business model.The committee urged an end to that impunity, arguing that the companies in fact have control and thus responsibility for their content.“Social media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a ‘platform,’ ” the report asserted. “That is not the case; they continually change what is and is not seen on their sites, based on algorithms and human intervention.”Among other proposals, the committee called for the regulators who oversee television and radio to set standards for accuracy and impartiality on social media sites, for the establishment of a “working group of experts” to rate the credibility of websites or accounts “so that people can see at first glance the level of verification,” and for a new tax on internet companies that would pay for expanded oversight.To address influence campaigns, the committee called for the mandatory public disclosure of the sponsors behind any online political advertisement or paid communication, as required in traditional news media outlets — an idea that was proposed in Congress as well.The committee also noted that British law currently caps fines for election-law violations at a maximum of 20,000 British pounds, which would be almost meaningless for an internet giant. The committee suggested setting the maximum fine at a fixed percentage of a company’s revenue. For a company like Facebook, that could be a much more threatening penalty.', 'Facebook Is Failing to Aid Inquiry Into ‘Fake News,’ British Lawmakers Say - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/technology/sexual-misconduct-silicon-valley.html': ('SAN FRANCISCO — Last September, the board of the online lending company Social Finance  ousted its chief executive, Mike Cagney, after questions about sexual misconduct.The move was prompted by a board investigation that found Mr. Cagney was romantically involved with an employee, even though he had previously told directors that he was not involved in any extramarital workplace relationships, said four people with knowledge of the deliberations. Years earlier, Mr. Cagney had also promised the board he would not have affairs with employees after they learned of another relationship, said the people.Yet just months after Mr. Cagney departed SoFi, two venture capitalists who had been on the company’s board and knew many details of his actions invested $17 million in his new start-up, called Figure. Since then, Mr. Cagney has raised another $41 million from others for the lending start-up, which will open soon.Mr. Cagney’s swift comeback — from ouster to new company took four months — provides one of the starkest illustrations of the speed with which the technology industry is moving past the sexual harassment allegations that swept Silicon Valley and many other industries over the last year.Apart from Mr. Cagney, 47, other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors who lost their jobs in the #MeToo movement are also rebounding. Steve Jurvetson, an investor who left his venture firm DFJ last fall amid an investigation into inappropriate workplace conduct, is back with a new investment fund. And Justin Caldbeck, another venture capitalist, has resurfaced giving public talks about what he learned from grappling with sexual harassment claims.Their resurgence is being enabled by Silicon Valley’s start-up ecosystem, where money is plentiful and many are eager to bet on experienced investors and entrepreneurs. In those situations, what happened in the past — even if it was in the very near past — often becomes a marginal factor, said Nicole Sanchez, chief executive of Vaya Consulting, a company in Berkeley, Calif., that advises tech companies on inclusivity.“The way the big boys do business is that nothing is ever personal,” said Ms. Sanchez. “It’s, ‘Can you make me money?’ It doesn’t really matter who gets hurt.”Mr. Cagney said in an interview on Friday that it had been a mistake to lie to SoFi’s board and to have the two relationships with employees. He said it had taken him many months to convince his investors that he had changed.“There was a relatively long process of them understanding how I thought about it: ‘Did I really learn a lesson from SoFi? Was I really going to try to do things differently?’” he said.But Mr. Cagney said he had never promised SoFi’s board that he would not enter into any new workplace relationships and he disputed that the board pushed him out last year. He said he had resigned on his own and could rejoin SoFi’s board anytime because he is one of the company’s biggest shareholders.SoFi declined to comment.The two SoFi board members who funded Mr. Cagney’s new company were David Chao of DCM Ventures and Steve Anderson of Baseline Ventures. They have both left SoFi’s board.Mr. Anderson did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Mr. Chao, who has joined Figure’s board, said he had pressed Mr. Cagney on what he would do differently and was convinced that the entrepreneur was creating a workplace “where all employees are being heard and treated fairly, period.” He added, “We believe that he genuinely learned from his mistakes.”There is no clear agreement on how businesses should think about reinstating people after sexual misconduct, and each case presents its own complexities. But Joan C. Williams, a professor at the University of California Hastings’ College of the Law, said the investors who funded Mr. Cagney’s new company despite being aware of his past problems were taking a big risk.“Should someone who just created an incredibly hostile work environment, and lied to his board, after doing what he had explicitly promised not to do, be hired as a C.E.O.?” Ms. Williams said. “It doesn’t seem like a close one to me.”Mr. Cagney helped found Social Finance in 2011 to refinance student loans online. The start-up grew rapidly and has gained a valuation of more than $4 billion, providing big returns on paper for his early investors.A year into SoFi’s life, the company’s board learned about Mr. Cagney’s personal behavior. In 2012, the board settled with an executive assistant who had received sexually explicit text messages from Mr. Cagney, The New York Times previously reported.The board learned separately that Mr. Cagney was in a relationship at that time with a woman in SoFi’s marketing department, said the people briefed on the deliberations, who declined to be identified because the details are confidential.After Mr. Cagney acknowledged the relationship with the woman in the marketing department, he promised the board he would not do anything like it again, three of the people said. The agreement was referred to by some employees as Mr. Cagney’s “fidelity pledge.”Several former SoFi employees told the Times last year that the board’s actions around the settlement did not prevent the spread of a toxic culture in the company. Last year, SoFi’s board started an internal investigation after a lawsuit from former employees alleged sexual harassment was pervasive at the company’s satellite office north of San Francisco. The investigation was conducted by the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.As part of the investigation, Mr. Cagney’s behavior quickly came under scrutiny. At the time, he denied to board members and staff that he was in an intimate relationship at the company with anyone other than his wife, who also worked at SoFi, the people familiar with the proceedings said.Mr. Cagney reversed himself after Sullivan & Cromwell told the board there was ample evidence — in emails, hotel receipts and the manifests of private jet flights — that he had used company resources to pursue a romantic relationship with an employee, the people said. Mr. Cagney said he had previously suggested that employee as a promising candidate for chief financial officer.SoFi has since settled the lawsuit about the satellite office. Mr. Cagney said on Friday that he took responsibility for a “get-it-done culture” that had led to some “untenable circumstances.” He added that he lied to the board “to protect the people involved.”After Mr. Cagney’s exit, it took SoFi several months to find its footing. The company hired a new chief executive, Anthony Noto, this year. It recently added two women to its board. SoFi also instituted an ethics policy that explicitly prohibits intimate relationships between supervisors and subordinates.Mr. Cagney returned more quickly. Within weeks of leaving SoFi, he began talking to SoFi employees about a new company, two people who met with him said. When he hired former employees, SoFi sent him letters asking him to cease and desist.Mr. Cagney denied on Friday that he had recruited any current employees at SoFi.His new company, Figure, is set to issue a variety of loans and to record every detail about them on a blockchain, the new kind of database that was introduced by Bitcoin. According to a business plan given to investors and obtained by The Times, the Figure blockchain will have its own cryptocurrency that will be used to pay loan holders. The company also plans to do a so-called initial coin offering to sell its token to investors.When Mr. Cagney began raising money for Figure last year, he approached current and former SoFi board members such as Mr. Chao of DCM and Mr. Anderson of Baseline.Both are prominent Silicon Valley investors, having made regular appearances on the Midas List, the Forbes magazine ranking of the most successful and powerful venture capitalists. Mr. Anderson was one of the earliest investors in Instagram and Twitter, while Mr. Chao had led DCM’s bets on BitTorrent and Bill.com.Both had also been on SoFi’s board during parts of Mr. Cagney’s tenure there and knew at least some of his history at the company, according to five people familiar with the investors and documents reviewed by The Times. DCM and Baseline invested the $17 million in Figure in January.Another recent investor in Figure, RPM Ventures, had also funded SoFi. A current RPM partner, Adam Boyden, was the chief operating officer at SoFi when the problems with Mr. Cagney came up in 2012.Mr. Boyden, who is now also a board observer at Figure, did not respond to a request for comment.Not all investors who Mr. Cagney approached, and who knew of his history at SoFi, agreed to invest in Figure, said three people familiar with the discussions.At the venture firm Ribbit Capital, some employees opposed investing in Figure because of Mr. Cagney’s past, three people briefed on the firm’s negotiations said. Ribbit eventually decided to invest in Figure. Ribbit did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Cagney has now raised a total of $58 million for Figure. He has set up offices in San Francisco’s financial district and hired more than 50 employees. He has told his investors that he sees an enormous opportunity ahead.', 'Sex Scandal Toppled a Silicon Valley Chief. Investors Say, So What? - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/technology/alex-jones-facebook-youtube.html': ('The digital walls are closing in on Alex Jones, the social media shock jock whose penchant for right-wing conspiracy theories and viral misinformation set off a heated debate about the limits of free speech on internet platforms.Facebook said on Friday that it had suspended Mr. Jones from posting on the site for 30 days because he had repeatedly violated its policies. The social network also took down four videos posted by Mr. Jones and Infowars, the website he oversees.“We received reports related to four different videos on the pages that Infowars and Alex Jones maintain on Facebook,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “We reviewed the content against our Community Standards and determined that it violates. All four videos have been removed from Facebook.”The 30-day ban applies only to Mr. Jones personally, not to Infowars or to any of the other administrators of his Facebook page, which has nearly 1.7 million followers. Those people will still be able to post to Mr. Jones’s page as long as their posts don’t violate the site’s policies — meaning that Mr. Jones could still appear in videos and stories posted to the page as long as he does not post them personally.In fact, Mr. Jones appeared on a live-streamed Facebook video on his page on Friday, shortly after the suspension went into effect, in which he claimed that he was the victim of a media conspiracy to “de-platform” conservative voices.“This is war,” Mr. Jones said in the video.Facebook may remove Mr. Jones’s page altogether if he continues to violate its policies, the spokeswoman said. This week, Facebook determined that one of Mr. Jones’s recent videos — an inflammatory rant in which he accused Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, of supporting pedophilia and pantomimed shooting him — did not violate its policies.On Tuesday, YouTube took down four videos uploaded to Mr. Jones’s channel, which has 2.4 million subscribers, for violating its policies on hate speech and child endangerment. The violation placed a first strike against Mr. Jones’s account on YouTube, preventing the channel from streaming live video for 90 days. If Mr. Jones receives two more strikes during that period, YouTube will terminate his account.“We apply our policies consistently according to the content in the videos, regardless of the speaker or the channel,” YouTube said in a statement.A request to Mr. Jones for comment was not immediately returned.This is not the first time that Mr. Jones’s videos have received a strike from YouTube. In February, YouTube levied a strike for a video claiming that David Hogg, one of the outspoken student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., was a “crisis actor.” YouTube said the video had violated its policies around harassment and bullying. But since there were no additional violations during the next 90 days, the strike was removed from the account.Facebook and YouTube acted after weeks of controversy over Mr. Jones, who first gained notoriety by insisting that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were an “inside job” by the United States government. Since then, he has questioned whether the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax, promoted the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy theory and said fluoridated water was part of a government mind-control plot.Despite these unsupported views, social media platforms have allowed him to gain a wide audience. Conservatives have accused Facebook, YouTube and other platforms of censoring right-wing views in the past, and have rallied behind him before.This month, at a press event in New York about Facebook’s efforts to combat misinformation and false news, a reporter from CNN questioned company executives about why Infowars was still allowed to have a Facebook account. At the time, the company appeared unwilling to say Mr. Jones’s content violated its policies.“Look, as abhorrent as some of this content can be, I do think that it gets down to this principle of giving people a voice,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said in a Recode podcast interview.As an example, Mr. Zuckerberg cited Holocaust denial as a message that he found personally offensive but was wary of removing from Facebook, in order to protect users’ free-speech rights.Within Facebook, the free-speech issues raised by Infowars and Mr. Jones have become an especially contentious topic. Employees have used internal chat forums to question executives about the site’s policies, according to one Facebook employee, who asked to remain anonymous because of fear of retribution. One group of Facebook workers, which included people of Jewish and Eastern European descent, raised Mr. Zuckerberg’s position on Holocaust denial with their superiors, saying they found it incomprehensible, according to the employee.At a House Judiciary Committee hearing this month, Democratic lawmakers pressed Monika Bickert, Facebook’s global head of policy management, about why Infowars was allowed to remain on Facebook. Several days later, two parents of a child killed in the Sandy Hook shooting wrote an open letter to Mr. Zuckerberg, criticizing him for allowing Mr. Jones and his followers to use Facebook to harass and intimidate the families of victims.“Our families are in danger as a direct result of the hundreds of thousands of people who see and believe the lies and hate speech, which you have decided should be protected,” the parents wrote.Facebook’s policies about misinformation have been vague and inconsistently applied, and the company has appeared flat-footed when dealing with popular purveyors of conspiracy theories and hyperpartisan content such as Mr. Jones and Infowars.In briefings with reporters this month, Facebook executives struggled to define the company’s policies regarding accounts that repeatedly post false or misleading news. The executives said that if third-party fact-checkers found roughly one-third of an account’s posts false, the account would be demoted, or “down-ranked,” in order to limit its visibility. The company has refused to reveal a list of accounts that have been down-ranked. Later, the company said it would remove, rather than down-rank, misinformation that could lead to physical violence.', 'Facebook and YouTube Give Alex Jones a Wrist Slap - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/us/idaho-prison-hack-jpay-nyt.html': ('Hundreds of prison inmates in Idaho found a way to add hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of credit to their personal accounts, officials discovered this month.The prisoners were not inflating their bank accounts, but rather their JPay accounts. JPay is a service that inmates can use to communicate with the outside world; for example, by using secure tablets or kiosks to send emails or listen to music.The Idaho Department of Correction learned about the hacking on July 2, and an investigation revealed that 364 inmates at five correctional facilities “had improperly credited their JPay accounts by $224,772.40,” Jeff Ray, the department’s spokesman, said in a statement.“This conduct was intentional, not accidental,” he said. “It required a knowledge of the JPay system and multiple actions by every inmate who exploited the system’s vulnerability to improperly credit their account.”The inmates inflated their accounts by taking advantage of a quirk in the system that did not cost taxpayers money. Of the 364 inmates, 50 credited their accounts with more than $1,000 apiece, and one person managed to accumulate nearly $10,000.In recent years, tablets designed for prison use have become increasingly popular. JPay is one of the country’s biggest prison financial services providers and has business in dozens of states. Inmates can use JPay to communicate with family members via emails, video calls and money transfers. Some can also access music, simple games or reading materials.“While the vast majority of individuals use our secure technology appropriately, we are continually working to improve our products to prevent any attempts at misuse,” Jade Trombetta, the company’s spokeswoman, said in an email on Thursday.“In this case, a number of individuals were found to have improperly credited their accounts, creating credits that could be used to purchase content. Once the issue was discovered it was quickly corrected.”Tablets have been marketed as a way to incentivize good behavior. But the companies that offer them have also been criticized for profiting from a captive market; when prisoners or their correspondents have to pay to communicate, the costs can add up. In 2014, a review by The New York Times of dozens of contracts found that states, counties and cities were seeking a substantial cut in return for letting such service businesses into prisons.The state’s Department of Correction said that JPay had recovered more than $65,000 worth of improper credits, and the department had charged inmates with disciplinary offenses that could temporarily revoke privileges or tighten security for some.“JPay has also suspended the ability of the inmates to download music and games until they compensate JPay for its losses,” Mr. Ray said. “The inmates are still able to use JPay to send and receive email.”', 'Idaho Inmates Hacked Prison Service for $225,000 in Credit - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/technology/personaltech/do-not-disturb-interrupt.html': ('Q. I like the concept of the Do Not Disturb feature on my phone, but I’m afraid I’ll miss an emergency call from a family member. Is there a way to allow calls from specific people?A. The Do Not Disturb feature, found in slightly different variations on Android and iOS devices, mutes calls, notifications and alerts so you can have some peace — but you can adjust the settings to let calls from certain people through the temporary wall of silence. You just need to make sure the people you want to hear from at any hour are on your list of favorite contacts.The Android settings vary by version and device, but you can usually get to the Do Not Disturb controls by swiping down from the top of the screen to the Quick Settings box. Tap the Do Not Disturb icon, and then tap More Settings. Select the Priority Only Allows option, and on the next screen tap Calls. Here, you can choose to allow calls from the people you have “starred” in the Contacts app, like family and close friends.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Greetings, carbon-based lifeforms! I’m David Streitfeld, here in San Francisco to fill you in on a busy week in tech.I got umpteen-dozen press releases, all of them about how new tech products and new tech people and new tech services will make you a better, happier, more successful person. To be honest, every week in tech is exactly like this. The future is full of promise, or at least promises.The present, however, can be brutal. To my mind, the week’s most important tech story was the slaying of an 18-year-old woman at a BART station in San Francisco’s East Bay, just a few miles from Silicon Valley, as she was getting off a train. Nia Wilson was traveling with her older sisters Lahtifa and Nishiya when, in a shocking act of terror, a man slashed her neck. She died at the scene. Lahtifa Wilson was wounded. A transient with a history of violence has been arrested.How does this relate to tech?The murder happened in one of our most public spaces, the transportation system used by all but the wealthiest. And it’s decaying visibly, rapidly, painfully. Every commute is an ordeal for BART’s two million weekly users, with cars jammed beyond capacity. Trains are filled with trash, the homeless sprawl over the seats, and the system is increasingly unsafe. Right before Ms. Wilson’s killing, there was another homicide. Right before that, there was an attack that might have prompted a death. (An investigation is ongoing.) Violent crime on BART is up 69 percent over the decade.Like New York’s and Washington’s subway systems, BART is falling apart. But even as public transit stumbles, another transportation story is playing out. Start-ups are deploying motorized scooters across the country — Charlotte, Baltimore, Cambridge — generally on the principle that it is better to ask forgiveness than permission. They dump them on sidewalks, and people turn them on with an app. Bird, the leading scooter company, now has a valuation of $2 billion. It is less than a year old, but investors are convinced that sidewalks are the next road to riches.Supporters say the scooters are fun and sensible, and will help relieve congestion. Critics say that once again the public infrastructure is being carved up for private gain, and it’s dangerous besides. Beverly Hills just banned scooters for six months, but that is an option that very few communities seem willing to take.All of this poses a fundamental question for Silicon Valley: As real life — BART, traffic, the cost of living — deteriorates, will people turn to tech in relief or in anger? Economic inequality stokes powerful emotions, especially when your nose is rubbed in it. There has already been one significant demonstration in San Francisco against the scooters.The scooter companies are part of Silicon Valley’s push for driverless cars, which advocates say are on the verge of happening in a major way. As a result, my colleague Emily Badger reported, they advise holding off on big mass transit projects that may soon be unnecessary. Some futurists go further. Brad Templeton, a software architect, argues the subway should be paved over to transport autonomous vehicles instead.Readers commenting on the story smelled a rat. “Autonomous cars are the new mechanism to kick the can down the road further instead of dealing with current realities,” wrote JeffB of Plano, Texas. “A reality where federal, state, and city governments are so dysfunctional and uncoordinated that they no longer have the political will to fund large infrastructure projects.”San Francisco still has some political will left. A law was recently proposed to ban new corporate cafeterias in the city. The measure stems from the tax break that Twitter and other companies got for moving into a struggling part of town. Restaurants followed them, hoping to capitalize on the generous tech salaries and refined tech palates. But the employees generally ate in the cafeterias, and the restaurants failed.Aaron Peskin, the city supervisor who co-sponsored the legislation, said he recognized it may be controversial, but that he wanted the tech companies to be more outward facing. He received the usual criticism on Twitter and in story comments, although I also saw one interesting counterproposal: Force the companies to open up their cafeterias to outsiders. If Twitter insists on supplying us with bile, the least it could do is subsidize our lunch.I have to get back to the press releases now, although I don’t even understand the subject headings on announcements like this: “Hitachi Vantara Named a Leader in 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Solid-State Arrays.”But that’s my problem. For you, I’ve got more compelling reading:■ Facebook stock lost $120 billion in value on Wednesday afternoon after chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said its two billion users really needed to get a life. Kidding! All that really happened was its quarterly numbers came in a little short and Facebook said that they would not immediately get better, but Wall Street thought it was the end of the world. For those who can’t get enough of tech’s favorite whipping boy, Casey Newton of the Verge has an excellent daily newsletter discussing the day’s social media tribulations.■ In “The Political Education of Silicon Valley,” a long piece in Wired, Steven Johnson discusses how tech folks have evolved from libertarianism to left-wing, kind of. I didn’t agree with all of it, but that’s politics.■ In a test of Amazon’s facial recognition software, the American Civil Liberties Union ran photos of members of Congress against a database of 25,000 mugshots. The software concluded that 28 of the lawmakers were criminals, including six members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Amazon said the software, which is being tested by police departments, was a tool and not a final authority.David Streitfeld has covered technology and its effects for 20 years.

      "{'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/sports/urban-meyer-ohio-state.html': ('Ohio State announced Wednesday evening that the school’s head football coach, Urban Meyer, was being put on paid administrative leave while the university investigates allegations that Meyer knew that a longtime former assistant coach had been accused of domestic abuse in 2015.Meyer told media last week that he had not heard of those accusations until they came to light last week.On Wednesday morning, an independent journalist published a report on Facebook in which the ex-wife of the former assistant coach, Zach Smith, explained that Meyer’s wife had extensive knowledge of the 2015 allegations, and that another coach’s wife had told her that Meyer had confronted Smith with the allegation.During a news conference last week, one day after the 2015 allegations first surfaced publicly, Meyer denied having had prior knowledge of them.In a statement Wednesday released by the university, Meyer did not address the discrepancy directly.Referring to Gene Smith, the athletic director, Meyer said in the statement, “Gene and I agree that being on leave during this inquiry will facilitate its completion. This allows the team to conduct training camp with minimal distraction. I eagerly look forward to the resolution of this matter.”The gesture of putting one of college football’s most successful and highest-paid coaches on leave as fall training camp approaches at one of the most football-mad universities in the country signals the seriousness with which Ohio State is approaching the prospect that a top official was cavalier toward misconduct.The university and its athletic department are already the subject of another massive investigation and several lawsuits as more than 100 former students have accused a former team doctor of sexually abusing them for a nearly 20-year period beginning in the late 1970s. Three lawsuits regarding the doctor, Richard H. Strauss, who is deceased, feature former athletes accusing the university of not doing enough to stop him.The statement on Meyer came from the university, not its athletic department. Ryan Day, a co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, will serve as acting head football coach.', 'After New Allegations, Urban Meyer Placed on Paid Leave - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/sports/mets-25-4.html': ('WASHINGTON — By sheer math, baseball is bound to produce unusual moments every so often. There are 30 major league teams and each of them plays 162 games, not including the playoffs.Before Tuesday, the Mets had played 9,035 regular-season games in their 57-year history. None was as lopsided as their 25-4 debacle against the Washington Nationals that unfolded that night. In contrast, Wednesday afternoon’s 5-3 loss felt like an improvement.It was the 26th time since 1908 that a team had won by 21 runs or more, but it will be long remembered by fans of both teams and, well, anyone who loves schadenfreude or who stumbled across a score more typical of football than baseball — except when the Nationals were up, 19-1.“We were talking about it in the bullpen: I can’t remember a game that I’ve been a part of like that in a long time,” Mets relief pitcher Paul Sewald said.It all began in the first inning with Steven Matz, the Mets’ starter, who had been pitching well until a recent skid. He left too many pitches over the plate. The Nationals, a team enduring its own trials this season, did not miss — a common theme on this night of nights, which came with an unusual setup: Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline passed a few hours before the first pitch without the Mets making a major trade to fill their many needs.John Ricco, the assistant general manager, said the team hoped to contend for the playoffs next season by building around its talented core of pitchers, which includes Matz.Nine of the 11 batters Matz faced reached base, including the opposing starting pitcher, Tanner Roark. He doubled in three runs. After seven runs scored, Matz was yanked with two outs in the first inning. It was the shortest outing of his career.Matz later blamed arm fatigue and Manager Mickey Callaway pointed to tightness in Matz’s throwing forearm — an alarming symptom for any pitcher, let alone one with Matz’s injury history.With Matz out of the game, Callaway huddled with the team’s pitching coach, Dave Eiland, to discuss how they were going to cobble together the rest of the game.“We figured it out by about the fifth inning,” Callaway said. The solution: multiple relief pitchers and then a position player, Jose Reyes, coming in to pitch the eighth inning.By using a position player, Callaway could save at least one arm, knowing that Noah Syndergaard was starting Wednesday’s game after a stint on the disabled list for hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Syndergaard did his part: He allowed three runs over seven innings on Wednesday, and was followed by only one relief pitcher, Seth Lugo.On most nights, relief pitchers wander over to the bullpen by the fourth inning, but on Tuesday night, Jacob Rhame was on the mound with two outs in the first. He allowed six runs over two innings. By the end of the third inning, the Mets trailed, 13-0.“It definitely happened really quick,” catcher Kevin Plawecki said. “Almost like a blur.”After leaving the game, Rhame sat in the clubhouse and brooded over his performance, knowing his uneven pitching created a domino effect on the rest of the bullpen.“I wish my 46 pitches would have lasted longer than two innings,” he said.Tim Peterson and Tyler Bashlor followed Rhame, and the score ballooned to 19-0 in the fifth inning. The announced crowd of 35,029 at Nationals Park thinned out as the game dragged on and a drizzle began.Those who remained cheered on the Nationals’ hitting onslaught.While the Mets finally got on the scoreboard in the seventh inning when Jeff McNeil, a rookie infielder, smashed the first home run of his major league career to tighten the score to 19-1, the Mets’ broadcasters brushed off a segment they call “media guide musings.” This is what they do when they can no longer discuss the game.Gary Cohen, SportsNet New York’s play-by-play announcer, opened the Mets’ media guide to Page 420 and read aloud passages about the 1969 team that won the World Series. He then passed it to Ron Darling and Keith Hernandez, two beloved players from the 1986 Mets team that also won the World Series.“This is like a Seder,” Cohen said.Gerardo Quintero, 32, a Mets fan in New Jersey, said the game was “the cherry on top of a lost season.” He added, “Any time they contact me to sell me a ticket plan, I tell them to call back when they are playing better and not an embarrassment.”Crouching behind the plate for all of this was Plawecki, who said he felt every sign for a pitch backfired.“Baseball is kind of funny,” Plawecki said. “I wouldn’t say helpless, but you’re trying to fight as hard as you can to get these pitchers to stay down in the zone. The hardest part is acting like the score is not 19-0 and trying to still make it a tie game. We’re still trying to pitch and get outs.”The most surreal moment came in the eighth inning when Reyes, a struggling infielder, fulfilled his dream of pitching in a major league game. Callaway warned him in the sixth inning to get ready. As Reyes’s pitch count climbed, Callaway sent Eiland to the mound to remind him to throw softer to protect his arm. Reyes gave up two home runs, six runs and threw 48 pitches, about half a night’s work for a quality starting pitcher.“Those guys were locked in, and they beat us up pretty bad,” Callaway said.Reyes was just glad to get three outs and save someone else’s arm.“Ultimately, it’s the same as if we lost, 5-4,” said Sewald, who warmed up hurriedly in the eighth inning as Reyes struggled to get the third out. “It’s just one loss. As a pitcher, it’s not fun to give up that many runs. I don’t care that six of them were on Jose or not. It still makes 19 that were on real pitchers.”Reyes hit two home runs in Wednesday afternoon’s loss, becoming the first major league player to give up multiple home runs as a pitcher and then hit multiple home runs in the team’s next game. Reyes said Matz, who didn’t finish the first inning, told him, “At least you got out of the inning.”While others will forever remember Tuesday’s game, Plawecki hopes to soon forget it. In preparation for his next game, he often watches video of his past performances. He said he would not bother rewatching this one.', 'The ‘Metsiest’ Mets Loss Ever - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/sports/thurman-munson-plane-crash-yankees.html': ('The anguish still rises unmistakably from the pages of the deposition, which is now nearly 40 years old. In it, a witness named David Hall hesitates as he testifies, and a lawyer asks if he needs a short break. Hall declines and continues.By the time he is done, he has provided a devastating account of the final moments in the life of Thurman Munson, the Yankees catcher who died at age 32 when the plane he was flying crashed short of the runway at Akron-Canton Airport in Ohio on Aug 2, 1979.Hall was in the plane when it slammed into the ground. In the deposition, he describes how in the immediate aftermath of the crash, Munson lay motionless, his head turned sideways and pressed against the instrument panel.Munson’s neck, it turned out, had been broken by the impact of the crash. His body was paralyzed. Still, Hall testified, Munson managed to ask him and Jerry Anderson, the other passenger in the plane, if they were O.K.And then, Hall testified, flames began to lick at the fuselage of the Cessna Citation turbojet, and Munson gasped, “Fire extinguisher.” What followed, Hall said, were the final words uttered by Munson, the hard-nosed All-Star and team captain.“Help me, Dave,” he said.Hall and Anderson tried. They strained to lift Munson’s immobilized body from his seat, to free him from the wreckage, but they couldn’t. And as smoke and flames engulfed the cockpit, Hall, a flight instructor who had previously taught Munson to fly propeller planes, and Anderson, a friend and business associate of Munson’s, had no choice but to make their escape.Much has been written over the years about Munson’s shocking death on that August day, but until now the depositions that were given in two lawsuits that were filed after the crash had remained stored away, out of the public realm. One of the suits, filed by the Yankees, was dismissed before it ever went to trial. The other, filed by Munson’s widow, Diana, did go to trial, but the case was quickly settled after some initial testimony.The depositions provide a kind of oral history of Munson’s life and death. They were uncovered this summer as a result of efforts made by Allan Blutstein, a lawyer who grew up on Long Island as a devoted Munson fan and has made a professional career of Freedom-of-Information actions, including recent, and controversial, filings involving employees at the Environmental Protection Agency.Blutstein did not need to make a Freedom-of-Information filing to obtain the Munson depositions. He simply had to be diligent and spend some money. After acquiring the documents, he made them available to The New York Times.The depositions, which include testimony from such notable Yankees as Reggie Jackson, Billy Martin and Graig Nettles, do not challenge the basic narrative of Munson’s death — that he was a standout athlete who began flying less than two years earlier, in part so he could get home to Ohio to see his family on days off, and that he died while practicing takeoffs and landings at the airport.But what the depositions do provide is a revealing snapshot of Munson, who was sometimes a curmudgeon but was always the bedrock of a high-wattage Yankees team that had won the previous two World Series amid all the distractions served up by Jackson and Martin and George Steinbrenner, the team’s unpredictable owner.It was Munson who continually played at a high level without creating controversies of his own. And it was Munson, the depositions suggest, who was both loyal and stubborn, both fierce and innocent.“Thurman had a routine,” Gene Monahan, the longtime Yankees trainer, said in his deposition on May 29, 1981. “He used to come to the ballpark, have a couple of cookies and a glass of milk.”Two months before Monahan’s deposition, Jackson — Munson’s co-star and rival, and then, eventually, his friend — testified that Munson had become weary of the sport he played and all the time spent away from his wife and three children.“He was more interested in flying that goddamn plane than he was in playing baseball — to me,” Jackson testified.Martin, in his deposition, said he was worried, as the team’s manager, that Munson was draining himself by flying between games. “I just kept telling him, you know, ‘I don’t like to see you flying during the season,’ ” Martin testified.In her deposition, Diana Munson was asked if her husband took greenies, when he played, a reference to the amphetamines that many players, in the decades before drug testing, took for the jolt of energy they provided. She said that he had, but added that she thought he had stopped doing so once he started flying.“As a flier, he knew he could not take things into his body,’’ she testified. “So after he started flying, I never worried about greenies again.”All of those who gave depositions did so for two concurrent lawsuits, meaning they had to testify only once. The lawsuit filed by the Yankees sought reimbursement for the remaining money on Munson’s contract. The wrongful death suit filed by Diana Munson sought $42 million in damages. Both suits targeted Cessna and FlightSafety International, the school where Munson learned to fly and became, by most accounts, a very good pilot.In her suit, Diana Munson claimed that Cessna pressured Munson to buy the $1.2 million twin-engine jet that crashed before he was ready to handle such a powerful machine. She also contended that her husband was not properly trained by FlightSafety International.Once her suit went to court, in May 1984, the case was settled in a matter of days and the terms were not disclosed. James Wiles, one of FlightSafety International’s lawyers at the time, still contends there was no culpability in Munson’s death on the part of either company. But a trial, he said, was just too risky.“You don’t go into northeast Ohio where he was probably the most famous athlete at the time, and go against his widow and kids,” Wiles, now 73, said in a recent telephone interview. “You just don’t do it.”Wiles, who was present for all the depositions, recalled Martin being both cooperative and savvy in his testimony. He said Jackson had been notably profane but that his transcript had been cleaned up.Hall’s testimony about Munson’s final moments, taken on May 19, 1980, brought forth tears, Wiles said, but other moments were less emotional.He said that when Yogi Berra testified, he put a box of 24 baseballs in front of him and requested he sign them. Berra, who was a Yankees coach when Munson died, grudgingly obliged, but at one point asked if Wiles was authorized to make such a demand.“It’s my deposition,” Wiles said he told Berra.Much of the testimony from Yankees figures centered on Munson’s physical and mental state leading up to the crash. Martin testified that Munson was the best catcher in baseball, better even than Johnny Bench, and so smart that he was the only catcher he had ever allowed to signal for a pitchout.But Martin also acknowledged that Munson, who played 11 years in the major leagues, was wearing down from the rigors of his position, and that he required more time at first base, the outfield and designated hitter to relieve pressure on his legs and knees.Munson had begun flying in spring training of 1978, and quickly grew devoted to it. There was testimony that Munson spent much of his spare time reading flight manuals and instruction books, even in the Yankees’ clubhouse before games.And both Martin and Jackson testified that Steinbrenner — who did not give a deposition — had granted Munson special permission to fly his plane from city to city during the season, separate from the team.“He had a special deal with Steinbrenner,” Jackson said in his testimony. “You know, Thurman was the most special Yankee when he was here. He could do anything he wanted to.”Jackson and Martin were passengers on flights that Munson piloted, as was Nettles. Nettles and Jackson flew with Munson from Seattle to Anaheim, Calif., after a game on July 12, 1979. Three days later, Martin flew with Munson from Anaheim to Kansas City, Mo., by way of Albuquerque.Jackson and Nettles recounted how, on their flight, the oxygen masks dropped down after a loud noise. They said Munson remained calm and landed the plane without incident. Martin described a flash of flames from one of the engines. Neither account was linked to the cause of the crash.Instead, the fault was attributed to pilot error, according to the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. It was determined that Munson was fatigued that day and did not properly go through his checklist and did not fasten his seatbelt.Charles Berry, an Air Force flight surgeon and medical officer at NASA for 14 years, testified in his deposition that “pilot error caused by fatigue and overstress” was the culprit, and he speculated that knee pain might have caused Munson to sleep improperly the night before.Critically, on the final approach, Munson never put down his flaps, which allow planes to fly at lower speeds, and that the engines stalled. The plane crashed about 870 feet short of the runway at 4:02 p.m. and then slammed into a tree stump.Both Hall and Anderson, who was also a pilot, had flown with Munson on that fateful day only because they had run into him at the airport. Both testified at the 1984 trial before the settlement was reached.As for Blutstein, his route to the documents began in April on his way to pick up his daughter, a student at the University of Michigan. Driving through Ohio from his home in the Washington, D.C., area, he impulsively detoured to Munson’s grave site in Canton and left a Yankees cap on the headstone.“I spent a good deal of time there,” he said, “and I started to think about what happened. I knew about the suit. I thought it might give me some answers to questions I had for most of my life.”After returning home, Blutstein began requesting information on the decades-old case, and his work in bringing other documents to light made it a routine task for him, but one that was time-consuming and expensive. He said he spent over $1,000 in fees and numerous hours filing forms and doing research. Of the 21 Munson files he requested, four were missing, including Anderson’s. Those that were located, he said, had been stored in a warehouse in Chicago.He has organized his trove and posted it on a Munson fan Facebook page for all to see, figuring that others must want the same information he sought. He was struck by much of what he learned, especially the poignant testimony by Monahan, the trainer, who had a close working friendship with Munson at the ballpark.Monahan testified that upon learning of Munson’s death, he went to an empty Yankee Stadium and sat in front of Munson’s locker for about five hours, almost in shock. Curiously, he testified that he tossed Munson’s medical records into the trash.Monahan did not respond to a request for an interview, and neither did Diana Munson. Hall and Anderson declined to be interviewed.According to Nettles’s deposition, Munson’s death cast a pall over the season. At the time of the accident, the Yankees were 14 games out of first place in the American League East. That was virtually the same deficit they had overcome the year before, in one of the most notable comebacks in baseball history. It would not happen again.“When Thurman got killed, you know, we just lost all — the whole season was just kind of lost,” Nettles stated. “We just realized we couldn’t do it and, you know, it demoralized a lot of us.”Of everything he read, Blutstein said he was particularly moved by Hall’s testimony recounting the crash and Munson’s last words. As a boy, he said, he had often wondered how Hall and Anderson could have escaped the plane without saving his hero.But after reading the depositions, he said he contacted Anderson to apologize for harboring such feelings. He said he also reached out to Diana Munson to apologize for the fact that the uncovered depositions would inevitably resurrect painful memories. He did not hear back from her.Blutstein, himself, made news in December when it was learned that he had filed dozens of Freedom of Information Act requests to the E.P.A. and that many of them targeted employees known to be questioning how the agency was being run under President Trump. Blutstein is affiliated with two political-research groups, America Rising and Definers Public Affairs.That, in effect, has put Blutstein in the middle of the political battles gripping the country. In contrast, his fixation with the Munson case speaks to something else — to heroism and heartbreak, and to fate.And Blutstein said he would continue to spend money and invest time as he seeks the rest of the depositions in the Munson case. “I can’t stop,’’ he said.', 'Documents Shed Light on the Life and Death of Thurman Munson - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/sports/black-people-pools-racism.html': ('The poolside confrontations keep coming.This summer, a black boy was harassed by a white woman in South Carolina; a black woman was asked to provide identification by a white man in North Carolina; and a black man wearing socks in the water had the police called on him by a white manager of an apartment complex in Tennessee.The encounters, some captured on video, have prompted widespread anger and resulted in consequences for white people involved. But they are hardly new: The United States has a long history of people of color facing harassment and racism at swimming pools.Pools are supposed to be places to relax, but ever since they exploded in popularity about a century ago, they have served as flash points for racial conflict — vulnerable spaces where prejudices have intensified and violence has often broken out.“That’s the most intimate thing,” said Greg Carr, chairman of Howard University’s Afro-American studies department. “I’m in this water, you’re in this water, it’s in me, on me.”Here’s a look at the resistance black Americans have faced in trying to access pools.In the 1920s and 1930s, pool construction accelerated as cities built lavish public facilities, Jeff Wiltse, a University of Montana history professor and author of “Contested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America,” said in an interview.In many cities, white and black people historically swam together, separated by sex. But norms began to shift as pools multiplied, with men and women increasingly swimming together, eliciting racist anxieties.In 1931, Pittsburgh debuted a new facility at the popular Highland Park, featuring a sandy beach with two large pools, according to the book. But, unlike the city’s other pools, men and women could swim together there.On opening day, thousands showed up, including many black residents who were asked by pool attendants to provide “health certificates” proving they were disease-free. Several later complained to an official, who assured them access going forward.When about 50 young black men arrived the next day, attendants let them in, but a larger crowd of white poolgoers jeered and attacked them, according to a newspaper report.That white resistance to integrated swimming was rooted in a fear of interracial contact between men and women, Dr. Wiltse said. The violent opposition continued for weeks, peaking when several hundred white youths severely beat about 40 black swimmers, The New York Times reported.The opposition persisted for a few summers, spreading even to single-sex facilities, according to the book.___In 1949, a St. Louis official determined the city could no longer segregate pools, concluding that, like other citizens, black residents “have a right to use public property,” according to a Times report.The next day, about 50 black swimmers showed up at a luxurious facility at Fairgrounds Park and were attacked by almost 200 white teenagers carrying baseball bats and heavy sticks, the report said.The clashes spread, and Mayor Joseph Darst ordered pools to be resegregated the next day.The following year, a local N.A.A.C.P. chapter successfully sued the city over the policy, according to reports, previewing the broader civil rights movement.Mayor Darst, who was white, agreed to comply with a judge’s order to integrate pools, according to “Contested Waters,” but he also decided to resegregate them by sex.The fight was not limited to pools, either.In the 1960s, black protesters organized “wade-ins” to demand equal access to the beach in Biloxi, Miss. Fierce resistance led to what an Associated Press article published in April 1960 by The Times described as “the worst racial riot in Mississippi history,” involving “gunfire, stonings and street clashes.” By 1968, though, a federal court would rule the beach must be open to all.[Sign up for our Race/Related newsletter to join a deep and provocative exploration of race, identity and society with Times journalists.]___In 1964, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference started a campaign in St. Augustine, Fla., to support local protests against discrimination and raise awareness of the civil rights movement.It included sit-ins, marches and what The Times described as a “dive-in” at the Monson Motor Lodge, where several white and black protesters jumped into a pool, a moment memorialized in famous photographs.One image, published on The Times’s front page, showed a white police officer jumping into the pool to arrest protesters. Another showed the white motel manager, James Brock, dumping muriatic acid, a cleaning agent, into the water near visibly distressed swimmers.The images took on near-instant significance. President Lyndon B. Johnson mentioned them in a phone call the following day, according to a recording of the call. The outrage, he said, underscored the need for civil rights action.“Our whole foreign policy and everything else could go to hell over this,” he said.The day of the call, the Senate passed a compromise bill prohibiting discrimination in the workplace, at public facilities and polling places, and elsewhere. Within weeks, Mr. Johnson signed the bill into law, enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[Catch up on a discussion on Facebook about pools and racial tensions with a Times journalist and experts.]___Five years later, the television personality Fred Rogers weighed in, in his understated way.In a 1969 episode of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” he invited Officer Clemmons, a recurring character played by the black actor François Clemmons, to join him in soaking his feet in a wading pool.“They didn’t want black people to come and swim in their swimming pools,” Mr. Clemmons said in “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?,” a 2018 documentary about Mr. Rogers. “My being on the program was a statement for Fred.”The two recreated the scene when Mr. Clemmons returned to the show in 1993. In that episode, Mr. Rogers, an ordained Presbyterian minister, helped Mr. Clemmons dry off his feet, evoking a biblical gesture.___As segregationist policies unraveled, many white Americans in cities retreated to suburbs with private or community-managed pools. But prejudices persisted.In 1962, T. R. Freeman Jr., a black economist for the Agriculture Department, rented a home in Fairfax County, Va., which included swimming club access. After Mr. Freeman’s membership application was denied, the white man who rented him the home, Paul E. Sullivan, protested on Mr. Freeman’s behalf, and had his own membership revoked, according to The Times.Both men sued and the matter reached the Supreme Court, which found in 1969 that pool access was a property right that could not be limited by race.From the 1970s to 1990s, cities faced with shrinking populations and rising budget deficits stopped building new pools or maintaining existing ones, Dr. Wiltse said. Public pool attendance dropped, and private pool construction increased drastically.___In 2009, a northeast Philadelphia youth camp struck an agreement to bring a group of predominantly black and Hispanic children to a swimming club pool in a mostly white suburb.On their first visit, several children and the camp’s director reported hearing “disparaging” remarks, according to a lawsuit filed at the time, including from a white woman who said: “What are all these black kids doing here? They might do something to my child.” Before a return trip, the camp’s contract was revoked, according to The Times.The club said the pool had become unsafe with so many children in it, but the camp argued racism was to blame.A state commission investigated and sided with the camp and, after the Justice Department intervened, the club agreed to a settlement.___When Simone Manuel, at 20, became the first African-American woman to win an individual event in Olympic swimming, the significance was not lost on her.“I’m super glad with the fact I can be an inspiration to others and hopefully diversify the sport,” she said then. But “I would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it’s not Simone, the black swimmer.”Last year, U.S.A. Swimming, the sport’s national governing body, found that 64 percent of African-American children have no or low swimming ability, compared with 45 percent of Hispanic children and 40 percent of Caucasian children.“Just imagine all the untapped potential,” Lia Neal, an American swimmer of African and Chinese descent who has won bronze and silver Olympic medals, said in an interview.“It’s great that we can use our platform and inspire kids who look up to us because they see themselves in us,” she said. “But we’re also not an easy fix for racism.”In an interview, Ms. Manuel said she experienced prejudice when she was 6 years old and a swimming teammate told her that he would not play with her on the playground after practice because she was black. Years passed before she told her parents.“I think I was protecting them from any negativity about their raising an accomplished black swimmer,” she said. “I guess for me, I didn’t really think I was different. It’s just a very innocent age. To think that someone that age could think like that is very disturbing to me now.”___In 2015, Dajerria Becton, a 15-year-old black girl, was at a pool party in McKinney, Tex., when a white police officer responded to a fight and disturbance. The officer grabbed her by the hair, pointed his gun at others in attendance and shoved her to the ground as she called for her mother.The episode, captured on video, drew national attention and sparked protests and a lawsuit. The officer resigned and the city paid Dajerria and her family nearly $185,000.This summer, in South Carolina, a white woman, 38, was charged with assaulting a black boy, 15, at a neighborhood pool, telling him and his friends to “get out.” In North Carolina, a white man lost his job after calling the police on a black woman who refused to show him identification at a private pool where she had an access card.And white female managers at apartment complexes in Memphis and Indianapolis were disciplined after they confronted black male poolgoers. In one incident, the poolgoer was wearing socks and dipped his feet in the pool. In the other, he refused to provide his address to prove his residency, though he displayed a pool access key.[Read more about other recent, high-profile incidents where black people engaging in everyday activities have had the police called on them for the thinnest of suspicions.]', 'Racism at American Pools Isn’t New: A Look at a Long History - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/sports/mets-yankees-trade-deadline.html': ('Midafternoon Tuesday, as the clock ticked toward the 4 p.m. trade deadline, three Mets baseball executives breathed deeply, peered into each other’s eyes and rolled the dice.No longer would the Mets stand pat. No longer would the team by Flushing Bay play underachieving little brother to that talent-laden team (to the point of ridiculousness) in the Bronx.Uh-uh, toss down time, brother. At 3:49 p.m., a Mets news release blinked onto computer screens across New York City.“The New York Mets today announced they have claimed infielder Jack Reinheimer off waivers from the Arizona Diamondbacks.”Reinheimer — Mighty Jack, to friends — is a career minor leaguer who is batting .237 with three home runs. Last year he made his major league debut at age 25, going 0 for 5 in two games.As neither liquor nor psychedelic substances were within arm’s reach, I opted for a case of the giggles. To watch the management teams of the Mets and Yankees this week was to stand on a platform as subway trains rumbled past in opposite directions.The Yankees are an express outfitted with stud conductors and plush seating. The Mets are a sweaty local with brake problems, a sick passenger and signal problems ahead. And that was before they lost to the Washington Nationals, 25-4, on Tuesday night, the most lopsided defeat in franchise history.More inventive management would take the Mets out of service for an overhaul.Three years back, the Yankees were a mausoleum tour bus, each season devoted to the retirement of a once fine and now doddering ballplayer. The team often stumbled into the playoffs, but just barely, before exiting. It was all kind of depressing. Then one morning, Brian Cashman put on his flight jacket and embraced a makeover as a hip-hopping deal maker.He drafted well — Aaron Judge, the Giant Slayer of Baseballs, and Luis Severino, a onetime whippet who has become a baby bull of a pitcher. And more to the point, he made deals like a swashbuckling stock trader. He traded and reacquired players. He shoved a cryogenic Alex Rodriguez into retirement. He would not stop.He was no less frenetic this trade deadline, acquiring yet another top relief pitcher in Zach Britton (collect them all!) and better than average starters in J.A. Happ and Lance Lynn. The Yankees didn’t get everything they wanted this week — they cast covetous eyes at the Mets’ ace Jacob deGrom — and the team has a case of the aches. Judge broke his wrist and is out for a few weeks. Gary Sanchez has hamstring and hustle aches.But this is a team on a pace to win 105 games.Which brings me back to that broken down train on the 7 line. The Mets had a tough break in June, as General Manager Sandy Alderson had a recurrence of cancer and stepped down. Jeff Wilpon, the Mets’ crown prince, sat next to Alderson that day, his jaw clenching and unclenching, making eye contact with no one.He had a choice of interim general managers. John Ricco was perhaps the obvious choice, as he had been an assistant general manager with the Mets for 14 years. Or Wilpon could have picked Omar Minaya, who had served as general manager in the past.Or he could pick both men and add a third, J.P. Ricciardi, as what is more coherent than a three-headed hydra?Ricco promptly hinted that “everything had to be on the table,” suggesting an innovative and exciting search for the best deal possible. Then they traded the team’s best reliever, Jeurys Familia, for two unexciting prospects and five pieces of plywood.Then Ricco suggested rebuilding was for chumps. “I don’t think we’re looking at a two- or three-year thing,” he said.So, a reporter asked Ricco, you think you can compete next year? He asked this in the manner a psychiatrist might inquire after the mental health of a patient.“Yeah, definitely,” Ricco said.Oh, man. Where to start? Last year this putative contender lost 92 games. This season the team began the season with the oldest starting lineup in baseball and seems surprised it has had lots of injuries and a record of 44-59, despite a 12-2 start. The Mets’ minor league system is a ship up on a reef. A year back, organizational swamis jabbered about Dominic Smith, the first baseman of the future. He hit .198 last year and .183 this year in limited time, and he’s hitting .259 in Class AAA.In fact, save for Michael Conforto, a fine hitter who is inexplicably pull-happy this year, and Brandon Nimmo, a nice looking outfielder who endured a long minor league apprenticeship, the Mets’ minor league system and draft picks are a walk through an arid land. Players with promise, such as shortstop Amed Rosario, arrive in the majors unable to bunt and with a swing long enough to bring a smile to the face of a big slugger.There is reason for optimism. The Mets’ three top starting pitchers, deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Zack Wheeler, have fine arms and would be well within legal rights to sue this lineup, perhaps the weakest in the league, for nonsupport. A reality-based general manager, with the support of a creative owner and much luck, might in fact figure out a way to contend in the next year or two.Reality, however, may not be a favored dimension for this front office. On the same day that Ricco claimed the team would soon contend, he emphasized that the team would be far more competitive this year. He noted that the slugging outfielders Yoenis Cespedes and Jay Bruce were about to return from extended convalescence.A few days later, Cespedes announced that he would have surgery on both of his heels and disappear for at least eight months. As for Bruce, the slugger with three home runs, he has yet to take so much as a practice swing.The Mets celebrated the passing of the trade deadline, and their acquisition of Mighty Jack, by losing to the Nationals on Tuesday night by three touchdowns.As it happens, the Yankees had bad news to announce on Tuesday. Their newly acquired starter, Happ, had contracted hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and will miss at least a start. This same disease has sidelined Syndergaard for a few weeks now.So a warning to that team in the Bronx: It could be that it is infectious to share this city with the Mets.', 'Victories in the Bronx and Delusion in Queens - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/sports/baseball/worst-losses-mets-yankees.html': ('Tuesday night’s 25-4 Mets debacle had fans scrambling for the record books. It was the biggest loss in franchise history, but hardly the biggest in baseball history.Indeed, the loss to the Washington Nationals was the 26th time since 1908 that a team has won by 21 runs or more. Here are some of the most memorable ones:Texas and Baltimore were losing teams, and this late August game between them was hardly expected to be significant. The home Orioles fans were no doubt pleased with an early 3-0 lead going into the fourth inning. The feeling did not last.After starter Daniel Cabrera was chased, Baltimore brought in reliever Brian Burres for the sixth, trailing by only 5-3. He promptly gave up eight runs while getting only two outs. And it kept getting worse. Texas padded its margin with 16 runs in the last two innings.Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Ramon Vazquez had two homers and seven runs batted in apiece for the Rangers. Amazingly, they were the team’s Nos. 8 and 9 hitters and finished the season with only 11 and eight homers.“Tonight there were some balls thrown across the plate and we put them in play,” Manager Ron Washington told The Associated Press in the understatement of the century.As for the Rangers’ bullpen, Wes Littleton came in for the final three innings, and earned … a save? Yes, in the rare cases when a pitcher finishes a game throwing three or more innings, he is eligible for a save, no matter what the game’s margin. Even Jose Reyes could probably have earned that one.Horrifyingly, the O’s had to come back and play a second game of a doubleheader just after. They lost that one too, 9-7.The Mets tallied four statement runs on Tuesday in the late innings to avoid a record shutout. So that title is still held by the crosstown Yankees, who lost, 22-0, to the Cleveland Indians in 2004, tying a mark set in 1975 by the Pirates over the Cubs.New York was in a pennant race with the Red Sox on Sept. 1 when it faced off against Cleveland at the Stadium. At one point, the Yankees had led by 10 games, but the lead had dwindled to four and a half.The Indians scored nine in the first three innings, particularly feasting on reliever Tanyon Sturtze, who gave up seven runs. Omar Vizquel finished 6 for 7.“There’s a certain element of embarrassment, no question,” Yankees Manager Joe Torre said.George Steinbrenner, the team’s owner, seemed more annoyed. The New York Times reported that he “brushed past reporters after the game,” adding that “he walked to his limousine, slammed the door and looked straight ahead.”Still, the Yankees hung on and won the division before making history of another kind by giving up a three-games-to-none lead in the American League Championship Series to the Red Sox.In this era of the home run, the Nationals’ total of five in Tuesday’s game might seem a little low, especially since two of them came off a position player, Jose Reyes. Their total is three short of the record in a 21-plus blowout. That came in 1939 by a powerful Yankees lineup that hit eight home runs against the Philadelphia Athletics.Joe DiMaggio and Babe Dahlgren had two homers, and Bill Dickey, George Selkirk, Joe Gordon and Tommy Henrich had one each.The Times called it “a long distance slugging spree unparalleled in the 100-year history of the national pastime.” (Toronto has since broken the homers-in-a-game record with 10 in an 18-3 win in 1987.)“A banner crowd of 21,612 persons watched with amazement this mighty display of power, which threatened to go on indefinitely.”That game was also the first of a doubleheader. The Yanks won the second game by the comparatively closer score of 10-0. The Yanks hit five more homers, with two for Gordon. Lou Gehrig, sidelined by the disease that would take his life, was met with an ovation as he brought out the lineup card for the second game. It was five days before his “luckiest man” speech.The Yankees went on to win their fourth straight World Series.', 'At Least the Mets Didn’t Lose, 30-3. The Orioles Once Did. - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/sports/lebron-james-instagram-nba.html': ('Marcus Derrickson was preparing for a stint with the Golden State Warriors at N.B.A. Summer League when his friends urged him to show off his gains in the weight room. Derrickson, a 22-year-old forward who played at Georgetown, was — and remains — a social media neophyte. At the time, he had posted all of five photos on Instagram.“I actually like to live my life,” Derrickson said, “and not do it through social media.”But his friends wanted him to flex his muscles for the world to see. They told him he should be proud of his hard work. And then they made their closing argument. “They were like, ‘You might as well do what LeBron does,’ ” he recalled.Derrickson followed through by logging onto Instagram and sharing a 5-second clip of himself doing chest flyes with weighted cables. He added a caption for good measure: “Focused.”LeBron James has used social media to promote his television projects, congratulate former teammates on their contracts and pine for pizza parties. He has used social media to announce that he is going dark on social media, at least for the playoffs. He has used social media to celebrate his wedding anniversary and share a clip of himself jumping off a cliff.But James, who recently decided to take his social media talents to the Los Angeles Lakers, has also used platforms like Twitter and Instagram to give his tens of millions of followers peeks behind the curtain — with glimpses of his off-season workouts. At various junctures of his career, James has posted snippets of himself running full-court sprints, balancing on inflatable balls and rapping to himself in a weight room.“The one where he was bald?” Damyean Dotson, the Knicks’ second-year guard, asked recently. “That one was funny, man. Good song, too.”James’s influence on the rest of the N.B.A. is impossible to overstate — and it extends all the way to his penchant for grainy, self-styled videos and photos of himself working really hard, almost always without his shirt on, in the hot summer months.“Everybody watches his clips,” Derrickson said. “He’s the best in the world.”The trend of posting these videos did not necessarily start with James — a representative for James said he was unavailable for comment, and the forensics of the practice are cloudy at best — but he certainly helped popularize it. “The N.B.A. is full of copycats,” said Justin Zormelo, a trainer who has worked with dozens of high-profile clients like Dwight Howard and Kevin Durant. “So when LeBron posts something, you can bet that 99 percent of the league is going to do it, too — the young kids, especially.”This is a quiet time of year for the N.B.A., but you would never know it from the flurry of online activity by some of the league’s stars. Joel Embiid is dribbling in an empty gym. Kristaps Porzingis is at a Latvian playground working with a kettlebell. Damian Lillard is showing off his six pack. John Wall is sweating all over a rowing machine. And none of these gentlemen are wearing shirts. Dotson, for example, managed to cram five topless dudes into one of his Instagram posts this summer, after an outdoor track session. The LeBron Effect is real. “Some people are probably like, ‘If you have to post your video, you’re not really working,’” Dwayne Bacon, a shooting guard with the Charlotte Hornets, said in a recent interview. “But people just like showing that they’re working, and I don’t feel like it’s a problem. It’s nice to let your fans know that you’re still engaged in the sport that you love.”Bacon cited that as one of his reasons for uploading a montage that a videographer compiled of him training back in April, less than two weeks after the end of his first season in the N.B.A. In the video, Bacon shoots a perfect 6 of 6 from the field. (Nobody ever seems to miss a shot on Instagram.) Like Derrickson, Bacon provided a caption: “Still Ain’t Satisfied!!” Bacon said he was an avid consumer of other players’ Instagram feeds, especially in the off-season. He rummages for training methods that he can add to his own routine.“It’s all about getting better in every aspect,” he said.Basketball, of course, is a competitive business, and these are competitive people. Troy Brown, a first-round draft pick of the Washington Wizards, made that clear on Instagram in June. He shared a film clip that features slow-motion dunks and feathery 3-pointers, staples of the genre, along with a caption that comes off as a sort of challenge to his peers: “I just wanna see if you’ve been working on your game like I’ve been working on mine.” Brown put it online a week before the N.B.A. Draft.“People want to show how much hard work they’ve put in,” he said. “It’s not a cocky type of thing. It’s more of a, ‘Hey, I’m in the gym and I want you guys to see it’ type of thing.”There are extreme cases. Joe Young, a point guard who spent the past three seasons with the Indiana Pacers, has nocturnal habits, and he does not like to keep them secret. He has used Instagram to share clips of himself working out with giant digital time stamps — 4:19 a.m., 5:45 a.m. and 4:02 a.m. — taking up half the screen.“You’re allowed to work out later,” Georges Niang, a former teammate, recalled telling him. “It doesn’t have to be at 4:30 in the morning.” Niang, a forward who has since joined the Utah Jazz, has adopted a more self-deprecating approach to social media. His Instagram feed includes a photo of himself flexing his arms at the gym — and a request for Photoshop help from his followers. (Niang is not a bodybuilder.) He also has a selfie that he took in the immediate wake of a hot yoga session. (He appears to be in no small amount of pain.) He always makes certain, he said, to give shoutouts to his trainers and fitness instructors.“I didn’t get this far by myself,” Niang said. As for his social media philosophy, he said: “You can’t be too hardcore about it. I also think it’s a part of building your brand and staying engaged with fans. You want to show people what your off-seasons are like, because most people only see what goes on during games.” Some of these videos are higher quality than others. Levi Randolph, a guard who played for the Pacers at summer league, had no intention of documenting his training sessions when he was home in Alabama a few weeks ago. But when a young videographer and college student named Jared Brashier offered to film him, Randolph was curious to see how it would turn out.Brashier, who had been doing some work at the gym, produced a short video in a matter of hours and sent it along to Randolph, who spent last season with SIG Strasbourg in France. Randolph was so impressed that he not only posted it on Instagram — “It brought a few clients my way,” Brashier said — but asked Brashier if he could document the rest of his off-season.“It’s kind of a trend,” said Randolph, who cited a series that the Players’ Tribune has been producing on Isaiah Thomas of the Denver Nuggets called, “The Book of Isaiah.”As for one of the originators of the craft, James has not posted any videos of himself training in a while. He has focused instead on his charitable endeavors, his TV projects and the next generation — by sharing highlight reels of his sons.', 'If an N.B.A. Workout Isn’t on Instagram, Does It Even Count? - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/sports/college-sports-summer.html': ('', 'How College Sports Killed Summer Vacation - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/sports/trade-deadline.html': ('BOSTON — Dave Dombrowski had no trades to announce on Tuesday at Fenway Park, which made him the exception among top decision makers in baseball. Dombrowski, the president of baseball operations for the Red Sox, could hardly keep track of his peers’ deals on a frenetic non-waiver trading deadline.“They’re pouring in left and right,” he said, adding later, “All of a sudden, conversations were coming out of everywhere.”Those conversations led to deals for almost every team in July, including the Red Sox, who acquired starter Nathan Eovaldi from the Tampa Bay Rays last week and second baseman Ian Kinsler from the Los Angeles Angels on Monday night.The rotation depth became especially important Tuesday when the Red Sox put Chris Sale, their ace left-hander, on the disabled list with shoulder inflammation. Sale will be replaced by Brian Johnson on Thursday against the Yankees, but he could return soon after that.“Fortunately for us, we’re a very deep team,” said Sale, who did not want to go on the disabled list. “We trust everybody.”The standings support that feeling. The Red Sox reached the deadline at 75-33, the first time in 72 years that they have been this many games over .500. They did not add a reliever on Tuesday, as many had expected, but finally found a sure-handed replacement at second for Dustin Pedroia, whose knee injury has probably ended his season.“It’s pretty simple,” said Kinsler, a four-time All-Star. “They’re the best team in baseball right now, so I’m happy to be aboard.”The rest of the league is chasing the Red Sox, who before Tuesday held a six-game division lead over the Yankees, who had baseball’s second-best record at 67-37. The Yankees kept most of their best prospects in July, while adding pitchers Zach Britton, J.A. Happ and Lance Lynn and significant international bonus money.The other teams in the American League East, meanwhile, shed many of their best players. Happ was the Toronto Blue Jays’ only All-Star, and the Rays traded catcher Wilson Ramos, who was voted to start the All-Star Game, to the Philadelphia Phillies for a player to be named. (Ramos has a hamstring injury and is likely to need a few more weeks before returning.)The Rays also shipped starter Chris Archer — a two-time All-Star and perhaps their most recognizable player — to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday for pitcher Tyler Glasnow, outfielder Austin Meadows and a player to be named. The Pirates, who won 15 of their last 19 games before the deadline, also traded for reliever Keone Kela from the Texas Rangers on Monday night.Including option years, Archer is scheduled to earn $27.5 million over the 2019-2021 seasons, a contract that makes him especially attractive to the Pirates, who rarely chase expensive free agents.“As we looked at the market, the ability to impact this year’s club and put ourselves in a better spot this year” was critical, General Manager Neal Huntington told reporters in Pittsburgh. “But it’s also important that we’ve impacted next year’s club and clubs beyond that.”With Archer and Eovaldi gone, the Rays will continue to start games with relievers. They have just one active pitcher who has made more than seven starts this season: Ryne Stanek, who averages fewer than two innings per start.The last-place Baltimore Orioles, as expected, were the majors’ most aggressive seller. They reached the deadline a staggering 42 games behind the Red Sox and completed a sweeping set of changes that began over the All-Star break when they dealt their centerpiece shortstop, Manny Machado, to the Los Angeles Dodgers.In the weeks since, the Orioles have sent Britton to the Yankees and reliever Brad Brach to the Atlanta Braves, who also grabbed pitchers Kevin Gausman and the injured Darren O’Day in a trade with Baltimore on Tuesday. The Orioles also sent second baseman Jonathan Schoop, an All-Star last season, to the Milwaukee Brewers for second baseman Jonathan Villar and two prospects.Schoop has no clear spot on the Brewers, who recently moved Travis Shaw to second to accommodate their new third baseman, Mike Moustakas. The Brewers acquired Moustakas in a trade with the Kansas City Royals on Friday, a day after trading with the Chicago White Sox for reliever Joakim Soria.Nearly every contender acquired more than one player who could potentially make a big impact in July, reflecting the clear lines of competition within the game this summer.“Certain teams have comfortable leads in their division races and are loading up for October baseball; I think that’s largely the American League teams,” said Matt Klentak, the Phillies’ general manager. “And I think in the National League, where there’s more contenders, a lot of teams are aligning their rosters to make a push to make the playoffs. There’s just a lot of teams that were active and looking to fill holes.”For the Phillies, who reached the deadline with the National League’s third-best record despite ranking 10th in runs scored, that meant adding reliable veteran hitters like Ramos and Asdrubal Cabrera, an infielder who arrived from the Mets in a trade last Friday.The Phillies held a half-game lead in the East over the Braves at the deadline, matching the Los Angeles Dodgers’ margin over the Arizona Diamondbacks in the N.L. West. Since the Machado deal, the Dodgers and the Diamondbacks have fortified their rosters in strikingly similar ways.Both acquired everyday infielders from the sagging Minnesota Twins in July, with the Diamondbacks getting third baseman Eduardo Escobar last Friday and the Dodgers getting second baseman Brian Dozier on Tuesday. The rivals also traded for setup relievers on Tuesday: John Axford to the Dodgers from Toronto, and Jake Diekman (from Texas) and Brad Ziegler (from Miami) to the Diamondbacks.If you need some time to process it all, you are not alone. Like Dombrowski, Klentak was eager to see how the landscape had changed after the blustery July trade winds.“I don’t even know if I know the full extent of everything that’s happened,” Klentak said, just after the 4 p.m. deadline. “This is one of the first times I’ve come up for air in the last few days.”', 'A Flurry of Activity as All of Baseball Chases the Red Sox - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/sports/nba-betting-mgm.html': ('The N.B.A. announced Tuesday that MGM Resorts International would be the league’s official gambling partner, the first partnership of its kind with a major sports league in the United States.The partnership is the next step in the process of betting becoming an accepted part of the sports culture in the United States after decades during which the major sports leagues shunned any official association with gambling. This year, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that effectively banned sports betting in most states, paving the way for major changes in the sports business in this country.As part of the deal, MGM will use official N.B.A. data on its betting platform and work with the league to detect and prevent fraud and game-fixing. MGM will also have the right to use N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. marks and team logos, and it will work on a coordinated marketing plan with the league.The N.B.A. commissioner, Adam Silver, has long said that sports gambling will eventually become legal and widespread in the United States. He called for its legalization and regulation back in 2014, and since the Supreme Court struck down the federal prohibition in May, the N.B.A. had signaled that it would be the first major sports league to begin profiting from it.In a statement, Silver said the league’s “collaboration will result in the best possible gaming and entertainment experience for consumers through the use of accurate, real-time N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. data, and our collective efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity of our games.”MGM’s chief executive, Jim Murren, said, “Integrating the N.B.A.’s assets and having official N.B.A. data showcased across the MGM Resorts platforms will provide us with a distinct advantage and instill more confidence in knowing that our data is directly from the N.B.A.”The value of the partnership with MGM was not disclosed.While MGM will be the league’s exclusive gambling partner for marketing purposes, most of the rest of the agreement is not exclusive, and the N.B.A. will most likely look to sign similar agreements regarding its data with other sports betting operators. The N.B.A. is eager to have every company offering sports betting use official league data and work with league officials to prevent manipulation.The league is also seeking a royalty from each bet placed on its games, as well as a say in limiting certain kinds of betting. Gaining these provisions may prove challenging, however.Despite the Supreme Court ruling, a federal law regulating sports betting seems extremely unlikely to pass anytime soon. That has forced the N.B.A. and other sports leagues to lobby in state capitals to influence the patchwork of state laws being passed across the country.So far, three states — Delaware, New Jersey and Mississippi — have joined Nevada in legalizing sports betting. None of the laws passed have contained the provisions that the N.B.A. seeks.New York’s proposed sports betting law contained most of the N.B.A.’s desired provisions and seemed poised to pass this year, a moment that would have been a huge boon to sports leagues because of the state’s size and influence. But the state’s legislative session ended in June without the law coming to a vote.The N.B.A., in partnership with Major League Baseball and the Professional Golfers Association, has paid lobbyists more than $500,000 to promote the group’s interests in Albany.Though the deal between the N.B.A. and MGM was officially announced Tuesday, the sides still need to iron out numerous details. It is not clear whether MGM will be able to offer betting on the N.B.A.’s developmental league or summer league, or if MGM will be allowed to use certain N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. highlights or game videos in its betting products.The N.B.A. has also not determined how it will provide its real-time data to MGM, or any other sports betting operator with which it strikes an agreement. Sportradar distributes league data worldwide, but for betting purposes only outside the United States, and the N.B.A. currently has no betting data partner inside the United States. The league could sign a domestic distribution deal with Sportradar or one of its competitors, such as Genius Sports, or opt to distribute the data itself.Sports leagues argue that requiring sports betting operators to use official data is safer for consumers. While the final score of a game would not be in dispute, two different data providers could differ on things like who is credited with a rebound, which is crucial when consumers can place bets on specific player performances in a variety of statistical categories. Data provisions have seen some of the fiercest fighting as states write sports betting laws.Even before this agreement, the N.B.A. and MGM, the world’s largest casino operator, had a close relationship. MGM has been the title sponsor of the past two N.B.A. Summer Leagues, and the company owns the W.N.B.A.’s Las Vegas Aces, who play their home games at MGM’s Mandalay Bay Events Center.The deal is just the latest in a string of moves MGM has made in its attempt to conquer the blossoming legalized sports betting market in the United States. In recent days, MGM has confirmed a $200 million agreement with Ladbrokes to become partners in the United States and announced agreements to operate in 15 states.

A. Happ was showing symptoms of coxsackievirus, a highly contagious disease commonly known as hand, foot and mouth disease. Happ, a left-handed starter, was acquired in a trade with the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday.Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard was found to have the disease last week and was placed on the 10-day disabled list.“How about that?” Cashman said before Tuesday night’s game against the Baltimore Orioles, which the Yankees won, 6-3, at Yankee Stadium. Masahiro Tanaka (9-2) pitched six shutout innings, and Miguel Andujar hit a three-run homer, his 13th home run of the season, in the fifth inning of a mostly drama-free game against an Orioles team with the worst record (32-75) in baseball.For the Yankees, the day’s drama occurred about three hours before the first pitch, when Cashman was told about Happ’s illness.“I got a call from our trainer,” Cashman said. “He said, ‘I’m not sure what’s going on here, but J. A. Happ has some complaints, he’s not feeling right, and he had noticed some blistering.’”Cashman said Happ had been sent to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, where he received an official diagnosis of a mild case of the disease. “So we sent him home,” Cashman said.Happ pitched well in beating the Kansas City Royals in his Yankees debut on Sunday and may make his next start against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park on Saturday.“There’s no real treatment. You just monitor the patient and let the virus take its course,” Cashman said. “He’s still scheduled to start. That’s not something that as of now is in jeopardy as of yet. The diagnosis is a very mild case, and our internist felt if everything is as-is right now, he probably would be able to go on Saturday. But it’s a to-be-determined story.”Cashman said the right-hander Luis Cessa would be pulled from his start for the Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders after one inning Thursday night in case he was needed to replace Happ.The right-hander Lance Lynn, acquired in a trade with the Minnesota Twins on Monday and expected to arrive in New York on Tuesday night, is also an option, Cashman said.“We’re in a fluid situation,” he said. “Interesting trade deadline press conference, right?”Before the announcement of Happ’s illness, it appeared the Yankees’ 2018 trade deadline would be a no-news-is-good-news kind of day.The Yankees believed they were done trading for the time being, even without acquiring an outfielder to fill the void left when Aaron Judge went on the disabled list with a wrist fracture on Thursday. They had acquired Happ to shore up their rotation and Lynn to add a long reliever to their bullpen in the wake of the Monday night trade of Adam Warren to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for international signing bonus pool money.Asked if he was disappointed that the Yankees had not made a “big splash” at the deadline, Cashman said: “It doesn’t have to be splashy. It just has to work.”Manager Aaron Boone called the team’s trade deadline moves “strong.”“I feel like Cash and the front office went out and got us some significant pieces to finish off our club and put us in a position to finish off what has been the start of a really good season for us,” Boone said. “We’re excited about the moves we’ve made. We think we’re a better club.”Happ’s performance on Sunday, in which he allowed the Royals one run and three hits over the first six innings of a 6-3 Yankees victory, appeared to cement his spot in a rotation that, aside from Luis Severino and Tanaka, has been shaky for much of the season. And with Severino struggling recently, the acquisition of Happ took on greater importance.But now, with Happ’s status uncertain, Lynn, a former All-Star who won 18 games for the St. Louis Cardinals in 2012, may assume a more prominent role. The Yankees originally intended to have him take on Warren’s role in their bullpen while making an occasional spot start. Beginning with Tuesday’s game, the Yankees face a stretch of 20 consecutive games as well as a makeup doubleheader against the Orioles in Baltimore on Aug. 25.“We had to determine if we could import someone who could be available in the event we needed more starting pitching, plug and play, or pitch out of the pen with more length,” Cashman said. “Lance Lynn checks those boxes.”But as for adding an outfielder to replace the injured Judge, Cashman said the Yankees were unable to find the proper fit. Judge is expected to be out until late August with a chip fracture of the right wrist after being hit by a pitch in the first inning of Thursday’s 7-2 victory over the Royals. Among the names mentioned to replace him were Curtis Granderson, a Yankee for four seasons, and Andrew McCutchen, a former winner of the National League Most Valuable Player Award.“We kicked the tires in a lot of different things, but we were not able to match up in a comfortable way,” Cashman said. “Right now, things stay as they are.”', 'Yankees Quiet at Deadline but May Lose J.A. Happ Temporarily - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/sports/soccer/major-league-soccer-alphonso-davies.html': ('You can learn a lot about a soccer league from its transfer spending.According to FIFA, the top six soccer associations by net transfer spending in 2017 were England, Germany, China, France, Italy and the United States. Five of those make perfect sense.The Premier League, the Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A are four of the top five leagues in the world, where clubs regularly pay huge sums to acquire the best players. China’s Super League recently tried to spend its way — some say recklessly — into becoming a global player. And then there is Major League Soccer.Despite its stated ambitions, M.L.S. is not considered one of the best leagues in the world. For years it pursued an attention-grabbing, star-centered strategy similar to China’s. American teams have a trade deficit worthy of a White House tweet storm, buying $69 million worth of players last year while selling just $2.4 million.But with a wave of youthful South American signings and a slick-dribbling Canadian teenager, M.L.S. is trying to change all that and produce some much-desired cash for a league that continues to lose money each year.The player who may shift the narrative is Alphonso Davies, 17, a Liberian left-footed winger who has already made 63 appearances for the Vancouver Whitecaps, the first when he was only 15. Davies, whose talents will be on display at Wednesday night’s All-Star Game, was born in a Ghanaian refugee camp and emigrated to Canada at age five.Groomed in the Whitecaps’ academy and the pride of a recent M.L.S. focus on so-called homegrown players, Davies was poised to emerge as the league’s brightest young star until last week, when Vancouver and the league announced that he would join the German powerhouse Bayern Munich in January, in the most lucrative player sale in M.L.S. history.Bayern paid the Whitecaps $13.5 million for Davies’s rights, an amount that could rise to $22 million if he meets certain performance criteria in Germany. In his first game after the deal was announced, Davies had two goals and two assists, at least temporarily quieting those who don’t believe a 17-year-old M.L.S. player can hack it in the Bundesliga.Davies said in an interview on Monday that consistent minutes in M.L.S. at a young age had been vital to his development, even as he acknowledged “everyone’s fear of going to the big club and not making it.”European soccer has had plenty of experience with American flameouts. Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey may have excelled abroad, but Freddy Adu and Landon Donovan proved less successful.For now, Davies, like most young players making such a move, is focusing on the upside. “If you go there at a young age,” he said, “you can develop way more than if you go there already in your prime.”Davies’s transfer fee is the highest ever paid for a M.L.S. player, surpassing — even at its low end — the reported $10 million that the Spanish club Villarreal paid for striker Jozy Altidore. That was a decade ago.The endurance of that milestone has been something of an indictment of M.L.S. player development, of the league’s inability to produce players who bigger clubs in bigger leagues wanted to buy.As worldwide transfer spending more than doubled in just the past five years, it had seemed strange that, even by accident, M.L.S. had not developed and sold a player who some club, somewhere would have valued more than Villarreal did Altidore. After all, M.L.S. is based in a diverse wealthy country of 330 million people.M.L.S. began requiring its teams to establish academies in 2006, to better train young players. Each team now oversees hundreds of youth players, sometimes down to seven-year-olds, and most have dedicated training facilities and residency programs.M.L.S. has supported these academies with initiatives like paying to send youth coaches to learn at France’s famed Clairefontaine training center. It is the maturing of this system that will hopefully produce more players like Davies.Bob Lenarduzzi, president of the Whitecaps, said the team tried to mimic clubs like Ajax and Lyon, who are successful because of the players they develop, not the players they buy. It quickly became clear that Davies would not be a Whitecap for life.“With someone like him it is just the natural evolution,” Lenarduzzi said.Selling homegrown stars could completely change the economics for M.L.S., as there aren’t many opportunities for immediate revenue growth. The league’s national television deal, which runs through 2022, pays each team an average of just $4 million annually, and most teams receive even less for their local television rights. Only so many fans can be packed into a stadium. Ticket prices rise only incrementally, even in a city like Atlanta, where demand is high.On the other hand, the average M.L.S. academy costs about $3 million to operate annually. The Davies transfer can cover years of developing more players just like him. Also, the $13.5 million the Whitecaps received for Davis is $5 million more than their total team salary for the season. It is more than the total season salary of all but four teams.For M.L.S., producing players in the fashion of Portugal’s Primeira Liga, the Netherlands’s Eredivisie, or the Brazilian or Argentine leagues would be a major achievement.There is one major stumbling block. Generally, when players sign their first professional contract or are transferred abroad, the club or clubs that trained them must be compensated by the signing club. Besides paying Vancouver for Davies, Bayern Munich will also pay a much smaller fee to the Edmonton Strikers, where Davies played before Vancouver.While this is how things work for clubs in Canada and the rest of the world, it’s not how things work in the United States. The United States Soccer Federation doesn’t enforce transfer compensation or solidarity payments. The reason is complicated and involves a two-decade-old lawsuit and child labor laws, but the upshot is that American clubs do not receive compensation simply for training a young player. They must sign them to their first professional contract.M.L.S. supports bringing the United States in-line with the rest of the world, according to Commissioner Don Garber.“M.L.S. is a winner in the solidarity payment world, and I have no objections to it,” he told reporters on Monday.There are other positive signs besides Davies. In 2017, M.L.S. clubs received just $2.4 million in transfer revenue for their players. Already this year, Jack Harrison, Cyle Larin and Érick Torres have transferred abroad for more than $1 million, and Red Bulls winger Tyler Adams seems likely to join them.Just for good measure, M.L.S. managers Patrick Vieira and Jesse Marsch have also moved to Europe.', 'Will Europe Start Buying Major League Soccer’s Stars? - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/sports/sam-darnold-holdout-jets.html': ('FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — When Sam Darnold jogged onto the practice field Monday afternoon, his Jets teammates interrupted their stretching to begin a slow clap, followed by whoops and cheers and hugs.Coach Todd Bowles had a simple message for his prized young quarterback: “You’re late.”Late to practice, late to training camp. Darnold, the No. 3 overall pick in April’s draft, ended a short contractual holdout that had kept him away for almost a week. The stalemate was resolved in time for him to rejoin his teammates at Monday’s practice just before drills began.Darnold was one of two first-round picks who still had not signed with his team, along with Chicago Bears linebacker Roquan Smith, the eighth overall selection. N.F.L. rookie holdouts became much less common after the league implemented a rookie wage scale in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement to establish strict salary guidelines tied to draft position.Since then, holdouts have typically revolved around language and structure. Darnold’s deal is worth $30.25 million over four years, including $20 million in guaranteed money, which is right in line with the overall value of the deal for last year’s No. 2 overall pick, quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. But Darnold’s representatives reportedly wanted some of the offsetting clauses and forfeiture language removed.That this would happen to the Jets — immediately embroiling their future franchise quarterback in a contractual skirmish — seemed only natural. But the atmosphere here Monday was actually rosy, and General Manager Mike Maccagnan insisted there was no acrimony between the two sides throughout the negotiations. (The Jets declined to make Darnold available for interviews.)“It’s a process,” Maccagnan said. “You try to execute a deal in a timely fashion. Sometimes it doesn’t happen as quickly as you’d like.”With so much at stake, and such little guaranteed money in contracts relative to other sports, player holdouts continue to haunt N.F.L. summers, agitating fans and front offices alike. Los Angeles Rams’ defensive end Aaron Donald held out for more money last season until he reported on the day before the team’s first game. He won the N.F.L.’s defensive player of the year award. Now he is holding out again.The Jets had to navigate a memorable impasse in 2010, when the star cornerback Darrelle Revis demanded a new contract and remained off the field until he got one in early September.There is also the case of the Chargers’ Joey Bosa, who refused to sign his rookie contract as the No. 3 pick in 2016 because of offset language as well. But the dispute spilled out publicly and got increasingly nasty as Bosa held out well into August before finally agreeing to a deal.Darnold has taken a different approach during his holdout and maintained an upbeat persona, writing on Instagram a week ago “#BackinNYC New York’s gonna to be good to me, and I’m gonna be good to New York #stoked”.He will still need to outperform the veteran Josh McCown and the former Pro Bowl selection Teddy Bridgewater to be the starter this season. Bowles said Darnold is No. 3 on the depth chart, but there is still plenty of time for that to change before Week 1.“The competition has been underway,” Bowles said. “It just didn’t start today. It started Thursday when we reported for camp. He’s got some work to catch up and do.”Darnold’s rustiness showed Monday during team drills when he stepped behind center.“It looked like the first day of camp,” Bowles said.He only ran plays he had learned earlier in the spring, because he had not been able to learn new ones that the team had installed. But Bowles said his absence won’t be held against him now that he is back in the fold.“You obviously want everyone here on time,” Bowles said. “But it’s a business. We understand the ramifications of missing three practices. But he’s got time to catch up. He’s got to put his head down because everybody has a head start.”', 'Holdout Over, Sam Darnold Begins Battle to Start for the Jets - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/sports/moe-berg-hall-of-fame.html': ('COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. — You don’t become the subject of an exhibit at the Baseball Hall of Fame by being a catcher who never played a full season and finished with a career batting average of .243.You need to have done something unusual.That catcher, Moe Berg, was a spy (code-name: Remus) during World War II for the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the C.I.A.If a catcher’s role is to help the pitcher deceive hitters, then the astute, defensive-minded Berg found his métier in baseball. But in spying, he found a true home for his penchant for secrecy, wide-ranging intelligence, talent with languages and ability to blend into his surroundings in a dark suit and dour expression.Berg’s mysterious life was detailed in Nicholas Dawidoff’s book “The Catcher Was a Spy” (1994), which was adapted into a film with the same title, starring Paul Rudd, and released last month.In late August, the Hall is expected to open “Moe Berg: Big League Spy,” an exhibition that offers a glimpse at the double life he led.“We knew the movie was being made and before we even saw it we decided that we had the ability to tell a really interesting story about Moe,” said Tom Shieber, senior curator at the Hall. “And we had a really cool collection with which to tell that story.”The Berg exhibit — which will be on display for about a year — is part of the Hall’s role as a museum dedicated to tracing the history and culture of baseball. With a vast trove of artifacts, equipment, images and ephemera, the Hall maintains a variety of permanent and temporary exhibitions that, for instance, describe the life and exploits of Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron and tell the story of African-American and Latino players in baseball.Knowing little about the Hall’s vast collections, many of the nearly 300,000 annual visitors are solely drawn to the gallery’s bronze plaques that describe the achievements of all the inductees. The Hall built the Berg exhibit largely from its collections, which included donations made in the 1970s by his sister, Ethel, and his brother, Sam. But it also has props from the movie.Berg’s baseball history is chronicled with artifacts like his catcher’s mask (with a hole positioned at the mouth for spitting), a bat (likely from his time with the Boston Red Sox), his official notice of release from the Washington Senators in 1934, and the letter from American League president Will Harridge asking him to play in the game that followed the first induction at the Hall on June 12, 1939.Berg loved baseball — it probably appealed to his love of strategy — but he lived a buttoned-up, nomadic life, traveling when he pleased, and never establishing roots with a wife or children. Perfect for a spy.“Moe Berg was a fascinating person,” Dawidoff wrote in an email, “a gifted man whose abilities shone in two difficult and widely divergent (if equally glamorous fields.) He was an excellent baseball player especially before his knee injury, and an even better spy.”Educated at Princeton in modern languages and at Columbia Law School, Berg traveled to Japan twice with other major league players in 1932 and ’34. His nearly pristine All Americans road uniform suggests he did not get much playing time on the latter trip.While the Americans were romping over the Japanese in a game in Omiya, Berg went off to Tokyo on an audacious mission of his own: with a Bell and Howell camera he had hidden under his kimono, Dawidoff wrote, Berg shot film of the city’s shipyards, military installations and industrial complexes from the roof of a seven-story hospital.After his playing days, he went to work in 1942 for the federal Office of Inter-American Affairs, an economic and propaganda agency that worked to promote cooperation between the United States and South and Central America. He resigned a year later and applied to the O.S.S. The exhibit displays a photocopy of his application in which he noted that his proficiency in French, Spanish and Portuguese is “fair” and his facility to speak Italian, German and Japanese was “slight.” He also detailed peripatetic trips to China, Burma, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Germany, Crete and England; some of those stops are memorialized in a passport that is on display.The exhibit uses photocopies of declassified documents from Berg’s years in espionage. In one partially redacted document, he demonstrates his knowledge of languages (“Folaga is the Italian name for the type of radar apparatus, corresponding to the Freya, made in Italy,” he wrote in a 1944 report) and applied physics (describing “diffraction of ultra-short waves on a hilly terrain”); in another, a telegram transcript, a decision was made by the O.S.S. to send Berg and another agent — Cabana — to Sweden.He showed his film of Tokyo to the O.S.S. but there is little evidence to show it was useful.There is nothing in the exhibit on his most-celebrated assignment: a trip to Zurich for the O.S.S. in December, 1944, to attend a lecture by Werner Heisenberg, the brilliant German physicist who won the 1932 Nobel Prize. Berg, who brought a gun to the lecture, was to shoot Heisenberg if anything he said suggested that Germany was developing an atomic bomb. Berg came to believe on the secret trip that Heisenberg was not supervising a German counterpart to the Manhattan Project in the United States. He did not fire his gun.But a faint echo of that mission is in the Hall’s files. In 1968, Berg received a holiday greeting card from Lt. General Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project (which had worked closely with the O.S.S. on plots to kidnap or kill Heisenberg).“Why don’t you run for baseball’s top job?” Groves asked Berg, probably referring to the vacancy caused by the ouster of baseball commissioner William Eckert in early December 1968. “I could give you a lot of advice on what ails the game today.”Berg’s exploits were the subject of a letter nominating him for the Medal of Freedom by Howard Dix, an O.S.S. colonel. Berg was awarded the medal but he rejected it.“I do so with due respect for the spirit with which it is offered,” he wrote in a letter shown in the exhibit. He was typically mysterious about not wanting the medal but instead asked for the return of his movies — including the one he took in Japan that had been exhibited to “several interested” agencies. But it was not of any military value after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.After his death in 1972, Ethel Berg accepted the medal on her brother’s behalf. Later, she gave it to the Hall.', 'Baseball Hall of Fame to Celebrate a Catcher (and a Spy) - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/nyregion/the-woman-who-plans-to-swim-around-the-world.html': ('The weather wasn’t cooperating with Jaimie Monahan on a recent weekend morning. It had rained heavily the night before, making the wind and waves too strong at sunrise for her to swim her planned 12-mile route, from the Brooklyn Bridge to Coney Island.Although conditions in New York Bay and the Atlantic Ocean had calmed down after the sun had risen, Ms. Monahan had missed her chance to train for the Rose Pitonof Swim, a grueling 17-mile race in mid-August. Instead she attended a morning yoga session on Brighton Beach, organized by Cibbows, the Coney Island Brighton Beach Open Water Swimmers.“The tide, the hot or cold water, wildlife, weather, it all affects open-water swimming,” she said.Ms. Monahan, 38, has logged over 75 major swimming events in 10 years as an open water, ice and winter swimmer (the total climbs to 300 if you include smaller events), gaining numerous accolades along the way. She is a seven-time United States national champion in winter swimming, and was inducted this year into the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame, along with being named Woman of the Year by the World Open Water Swimming Association for both 2016 and 2017.As if she’s not busy enough swimming and collecting awards, Ms. Monahan also has a full-time job as a recruiter for Deloitte, the global auditing and consulting firm. But this month, she won’t be putting in much cubicle time. Ms. Monahan will be attempting to obtain a Guinness World Record as the fastest person to complete six marathon swims on six continents within 16 days (a marathon swimming event, which can vary in distance, must be at least 6.2 miles). Her first qualifying event will be the Pitonof Swim, which will start in Manhattan at East 26th Street and finish at Steeplechase Pier in Coney Island.Later that day, she will head to the airport for a flight to Colombia. Following in rapid succession will be flights to and swims in the waters of Australia, Singapore, Egypt and Switzerland.“I actually don’t see myself as superathletic,” she said. “Kinda more like a penguin; clumsy on land but graceful in the water.”Ms. Monahan has always been a swimmer — she swam butterfly and individual medley for her high school and college teams — but her love for open water swimming didn’t become a passion until she started to train for a triathlon with her boyfriend of 18 years, Arik Thormahlen, 41, a fund-raiser in health and higher education.She then read about Rose Pitonof, a teenager who swam from Manhattan to Coney Island in 1911 (the event named after Ms. Pitonof follows her original trajectory), and Lynne Cox, an athlete perhaps best-known for swimming across the Bering Strait. She found these women so inspiring, it fueled her interest further. After participating in events in California and Florida as a test run, Ms. Monahan swam the 21-mile English Channel in 2009.“Jaimie carries the love and spirit Rose had,” said Deanne Draeger, the founder of Urban Swim, a local group that organizes the annual Pitonof swim and other clean-water advocacy programs. “They’re both vivacious, charming and passionate.”After becoming the first person to complete the Ice Sevens Challenge, where the rules stipulate that the water temperature be below 41 degrees Fahrenheit and that seven one-mile swims must be performed on all seven continents, Ms. Monahan said she needed a new goal. Two years ago, she started planning her marathon swims.When her Deloitte schedule allows, Ms. Monahan likes to exercise four to seven times a week, which includes high-intensity workouts at the gym, yoga and swimming both indoors and out. On the weekends, she joins group swims or goes on long solo swims organized by Cibbows.And there is a lot to organize. Capri Djatiasmoro, who is on the Cibbows board, sometimes must secure authorization from the United States Coast Guard and notify the New York Police Department’s harbor unit about the swim routes and start times. A police boat always accompanies the swims, and depending on the course location, the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation may also have to be notified.During long-distance swims, Ms. Djatiasmoro, along with the boat’s captain and Mr. Thormahlen, is next to Ms. Monahan on a rigid hull inflatable boat. Using sonar, radar and her own two eyes, Ms. Djatiasmoro said she is on a constant lookout for other boats, Jet Skis, debris and, at times, birds.“Sometimes you look up and see lots of birds circling above and you know there’s fish under the swimmer, so you slightly alter their course,” she said.Organizing the upcoming challenge has taken over a year. Besides logistics like booking flights and accommodations, Ms. Monahan had to get permission from the right authorities to swim in various international waters. Mr. Thormahlen, who said he’s been happy to do much of the research on gear, is excited to try out a new kind of ocean kayak, which, inspired by origami, folds into a compact parcel.“When I opened it for the first time in our house, it took over our entire kitchen,” Mr. Thormahlen said of the Oru Kayak. He will be traveling with Ms. Monahan for all of her swims and using the kayak to help her stay on course.Besides bringing eight bathing suits, Ms. Monahan, who has very fair skin, plans to take 24 ounces of Desitin, a diaper rash cream, which she slathers all over in lieu of sunblock, and bags of CarboPro powder, an energy supplement, which she drinks every 30 minutes during her swims.Ms. Monahan said she sometimes sings songs in her head while she swims, but mostly focuses on the nature around her. On occasion, she has listened to dolphins whistle, and she has swum with a penguin in Antarctica. Jellyfish and insects are bothersome, but she doesn’t let them get to her since a solid mental state, and the ability to react to sudden changes in the water, is important in open water swimming. Although Ms. Monahan said she wasn’t letting the notion consume her, she and Mr. Thormahlen are aware that there are pirates in the Malacca and Singapore Straits.Ms. Monahan is using up two weeks of vacation for the upcoming adventure.“It’s funny when someone from the office asks you what you did over the weekend,” she said. “Sometimes I was swimming on the other side of the world.”Project The Guinness World Record for fastest person to complete six marathon swims on six continents.Sites New York (Manhattan to Coney Island); Colombia (Tierra Bomba Island in the Caribbean); Australia (Bondi Beach to Watsons Bay in the South Pacific); the Malacca and Singapore Straits; Egypt (the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea); Switzerland (Lausanne to Évian-les Bains via Lake Geneva).In the works Since 2016Driving forces Jaimie Monahan and Arik ThormahlenCost About $12,000Biggest Obstacles Weather, water temperature, wildlife, pirates', 'The Woman Who Plans to Swim Around the World - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/sports/baseball/mets-nationals-lopsided-loss.html': ('WASHINGTON — On pace to lose more than 90 games, the Mets have endured a fair amount of misery, injuries and mistakes this season. Then came Tuesday night and a new nadir.The Mets lost to the Washington Nationals, 25-4, the most lopsided loss in the team’s 57-year history. Seven Mets pitchers took the mound, and all but two coughed up runs, including the veteran infielder Jose Reyes. In all, the Mets gave up 26 hits, the second-highest total in team history.“A tough loss,” Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said after the game. “It’s embarrassing. We gotta do better than that.”The Mets have given up more runs in a game before. That distinction belongs to the 1985 squad, which lost by a score of 26-7 to the Philadelphia Phillies on June 11 of that year. But that team at least made up for it by finishing the season with 98 wins and would go on to be World Series winners the next year.This year’s Mets are mired in gloominess with little way out. Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline came and passed without a major trade to improve the team. Earlier in the day, John Ricco, the assistant general manager, insisted the Mets could contend for the playoffs in 2019 because of the team’s talented core of pitchers.His words did not prove true in the evening. Steven Matz, one of the starting pitchers the Mets hope to build around, surrendered seven runs and lasted only two outs in the shortest start of his career.After some uneven defense in the bottom of the first inning, first baseman Wilmer Flores also came out of the game. The Mets later announced it was because he felt dizzy and dehydrated, another unusual ailment in a season full of them.“I wasn’t even there,” Flores said. “I felt lost.”It made little difference who was on the mound or in the field. The Nationals smashed five home runs, including two by the former Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy. By the third inning, the Mets trailed by a score of 13-0.The only two relief pitchers who did not allow a run were Jerry Blevins and Drew Smith, who combined to pitch two and a third innings.By the fifth inning, Callaway knew he would need to use a position player to avoid burning through everyone in the bullpen. Noah Syndergaard, who is returning from a stint on the disabled list for hand, foot and mouth disease, was slated to start on Wednesday, so the Mets wanted to keep some relief pitchers fresh just in case.In the sixth inning, Callaway asked Reyes, the struggling backup infielder, if he was willing pitch. Reyes, who had been hoping to get a chance to pitch before he retired, said yes.The last time Reyes, 35, pitched was when he was 11 or 12 years old in his native Dominican Republic.“When you get on the mound and before you throw a pitch, it’s fun,” he said. “But when you start to see people hit a homer and stuff, you get more serious. Even though I’m not a pitcher, you don’t want to see that. I want to put a zero up there. But I do the best that I can.”Juan Soto, the Nationals rookie outfielder, laughed as he stepped in the batter’s box. First baseman Ryan Zimmerman, a longtime opponent of Reyes, even faked charging the mound after Reyes hit him with a pitch.“That was pretty funny and surreal to hit against him,” Zimmerman said.In all, Reyes, throwing from a sidearm position, gave up six runs on five hits, including two home runs. He threw 48 pitches, a concerning number for anyone who might be asked to pitch again anytime soon. Reyes hit 87 miles per hour with his fastball and threw a curveball in the 60s.As Reyes’s pitch count ballooned, Callaway grew concerned and sent pitching coach Dave Eiland to the mound to check on Reyes, who was also worried about hurting his arm. Paul Sewald, a relief pitcher, warmed up in the bullpen as an emergency.“I’m glad that I got out of the inning and Mickey don’t need to use to another position player or pitcher,” Reyes said.', 'Mets Endure Most Lopsided Defeat in Franchise History - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/sports/mets-trade-deadline.html': ('WASHINGTON — It was clear long ago that this Mets season was lost. Entering Tuesday, they had the third-worst record in the National League.So why did the non-waiver trade deadline pass on Tuesday afternoon without the Mets plugging some of their holes by, perhaps, trading Noah Syndergaard or Zack Wheeler? Why would the team do nothing beyond two trades earlier in July? If the Mets hope to contend for the playoffs next year, when does that overhaul begin?Like much around Flushing, it’s complicated.“We were not going to move those players unless it involved considerable talent coming back in our direction,” John Ricco, the longtime assistant general manager, said in a conference call with reporters after the deadline.Hours after Ricco extolled the Mets’ core of pitching talent, they endured the most lopsided loss in team history, a 25-4 thumping by the Washington Nationals, who collected 26 hits. Starting pitcher Steven Matz lasted only two outs and gave up seven runs.He was one of seven Mets to take the mound, which included the infielder Jose Reyes making the first pitching appearance of his 16-year career. There were a few laughs, but it was a slog for Reyes, too: despite flashing an 86-mile per hour fastball with his sidearm delivery, he coughed up six runs, two home runs and threw 48 pitches.Any potential trade of their talented pitchers under more than a year of team control — Jacob deGrom, Matz, Syndergaard or Wheeler — was always going to be difficult anyway.Since General Manager Sandy Alderson stepped aside last month because of a recurrence of cancer, the Mets have been led by a group of three executives: Ricco and two special assistants, J.P. Ricciardi and Omar Minaya. The group is overseen by Jeff Wilpon, the team’s chief operating officer.The fill-in front office was there for the slam dunk deals, such as trading the free-agents-to-be, infielder Asdrubal Cabrera and closer Jeurys Familia, or to accept should a desperate rival attempt to overpay for one of the team’s talented pitchers.Ricco insisted that the lack of one general manager did not hurt the Mets and that the Wilpons, the Mets owners, gave the interim front office the opportunity to make a larger, more difficult trade.“I’ve been here through multiple regimes and been through a lot of trade deadlines. I thought we operated as smoothly during this one as during any other time period I’ve been here,” Ricco said.Ricco said the Mets simply found that contending teams were less willing to trade major league players and that non-contenders wanting pitching were not going to pay the desired premium. He said the off-season may be better: The Mets will have an opportunity to discuss trades with 29 teams, not just a handful of contenders.For now, deGrom, a top candidate in the N.L. Cy Young race, would be harder to trade given his importance and reliability. But Syndergaard or Wheeler could be intriguing to teams with deep farm systems, such as the San Diego Padres, a rebuilding franchise that was recently interested in Syndergaard.“We want to build around the pitching we have and have a winning team and compete for a playoff spot next year,” Ricco said. “There was no deal on the table that we thought made sense at this point in time. That does not say anything about how we’re going to treat our assets heading into the off-season and how we’re going to plan for next year.”Wheeler posed the most interesting case for a trade by Tuesday: Despite a long injury history and beginning the season in the minor leagues, he has remained healthy and posted a 3.20 earned run average since the start of June. And since Wheeler is slated to hit free agency after next season — sooner than Syndergaard, deGrom or Matz — why not sell at the highest value?Despite interest from several teams, the Mets did not receive an offer they deemed strong enough for Wheeler. While the Mets saw a strong pitcher, the rest of baseball saw a pitcher with lingering questions about injury and performance.The Mets were not idle in July. They traded Familia to the Oakland Athletics and Cabrera to the Phillies for three prospects and international slot space. The Mets saved nearly $6 million as a result of the trades and added some talent to their meager farm system. But both of those trades were easy decisions: Familia and Cabrera were free agents at the end of this season.There is still, of course, an opportunity for the Mets to be active in August. Jose Bautista, a veteran bat, and Devin Mesoraco, the catcher acquired in exchange for Matt Harvey, are the type of players that could be let go in waivers or traded.Whatever the case, the Mets still have a lot of work to do if they want to contend next season. Will they spend the money on or trade for needed top talent?Money is often a hot topic in Flushing. Few teams have spent as much in free agency as the Mets the past two winters, but most of those deals — Jason Vargas, Jay Bruce, Todd Frazier and Yoenis Cespedes, among others — have been disappointing because of poor performances or injuries.Ricco said the Mets had the basis for a strong pitching staff behind the rotation, and a bullpen stocked with Anthony Swarzak, Seth Lugo, Robert Gsellman and other young inexperienced hard-throwers. The lineup and defense need work, though.“Our strength is our pitching so we need to support that in every possible way,” Ricciardi said. “The more athletic we become, the better we’ll become as a team.”The heavy lifting on the Mets’ revamping will more than likely have to wait until the winter — with a new general manager in place.', 'With No Attractive Offers, the Mets Stand Pat - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/obituaries/nikolai-volkoff-soviet-villain-in-the-wrestling-ring-is-dead-at-70.html': ('Nikolai Volkoff, a massive ex-weight lifter who played a Soviet villain in the professional wrestling ring and battled the likes of Bruno Sammartino and Hulk Hogan, died on Sunday at his home in Glen Arm, Md. He was 70.His wife, Lynn Peruzovic, confirmed the death and said he had recently been hospitalized with heart problems.Volkoff portrayed a Communist heel with convincing panache, wearing Soviet-style apparel, like an ushanka fur cap, into the ring and singing the country’s national anthem before matches. It was an ideal Cold War shtick in wrestling, where good vs. evil is an evergreen story line.But even as the act turned him into a major star and brought him championship titles, he was uncomfortable in the Soviet guise. He was actually a Croatian born in Yugoslavia as Josip Hrvoje Peruzovic.“They made me into a Soviet bad guy,” Volkoff said in “Listen, You Pencil Neck Geeks” (2004), the autobiography of his flashy manager, Freddie Blassie, which was written with Keith Elliot Greenberg. “See, even though I’m from Yugoslavia, my mother’s Russian and I speak the language. My father is Croatian and Italian, and there were too many Italians already in wrestling. Croatians nobody knew about.”But, he added, he disliked the character that Blassie created for him. He detested life in Communist Yugoslavia and said in the book that he could not wait to flee.He did so in 1968, after a competition in Vienna, going to the Canadian Embassy and defecting.“I was just so happy to get out from there,” he said in an interview for the book “The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels” (2007), by Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson. “Those Communist bastards. I hated them.”Blassie insisted that Volkoff’s revenge on the Communists he loathed would be to “show people how bad they are.”In 2013, Volkoff told The Baltimore Sun: “It was unbelievable. I was the most hated wrestler in the United States at the time.”Volkoff acted the Soviet baddie for many years. When he wrestled Hogan in 1985, they carried the flags of their respective countries to the ring. Once inside, Volkoff stripped off what appeared to be a World War II Soviet military coat. When their match began, Volkoff — 6-foot-5 and more than 300 pounds — twice lifted the even larger Hogan over his head.But Hogan, the self-appointed protector of America, defeated Volkoff.Volkoff won several championship titles. But the most prestigious one was the tag-team belt that he took home in 1985 with the Iron Sheik, another anti-American character, for the World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment).Volkoff was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.Josip Peruzovic was born on Oct. 14, 1947, to Ivan and Drajica Peruzovic in Split, Croatia, when it was part of Yugoslavia. He was a junior weight lifting champion in his country.At the time of his defection, he spoke no English. Finding his way to Calgary, Alberta, he trained with Stu Hart and Newton Tattrie, with whom he formed The Mongols, a tag team partnership in which Peruzovic was Bepo and Tattrie was Geeto. They briefly held the wrestling federation’s international tag team championship in 1971.Eventually, under Blassie’s tutelage, Peruzovic became Nikolai Volkoff, the Soviet scourge.Bruno Sammartino, the popular and gentlemanly champion, was one of Volkoff’s most frequent rivals.In March 1974, nearly four years after Volkoff (then billed as Bepo Mongol) defeated Sammartino, the two battled to a draw for 53 minutes at a sold-out Madison Square Garden until the 11 p.m. curfew.“The Siberian,” as The Daily News referred to Volkoff, “was tremendously effective in the first half of the match and especially in the closing minutes when he had Bruno’s shoulders to the canvas for counts of two on three occasions.”Volkoff called it his most important match. But Sammartino triumphed in their rematch the next month. (Sammartino died in April.)The end of the Cold War did more than force the fall of the Berlin Wall. It turned Volkoff into a good guy when he teamed up with the uber-patriotic Hacksaw Jim Duggan in the 1990s. Volkoff continued to wrestle, on and off, until last year.In addition to his wife, the former Lynn Breidenbaugh, he is survived by his daughters, Kirsten Peruzovic and Kara Lipinski; and his brothers, Ante and Tihomir.In the latter years of his wrestling career Volkoff became a county code-enforcement inspector in Baltimore. In 2006, under the Volkoff name, he ran unsuccessfully in a Republican primary for a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates. He finished last in a field of five.He also worked with children at a recreation center in Cockeysville, Md., teaching them chess and pool and supervising some in weight lifting.“We just want to give kids a healthy environment,” the once-fearsome heel told The Sun, “so they stay away from troubles.”', 'Nikolai Volkoff, Soviet Villain in the Wrestling Ring, Is Dead at 70 - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/sports/baseball/lance-lynn-yankees-trade.html': ('The Yankees continued the recent reshaping of their pitching staff, acquiring right-hander Lance Lynn from the Minnesota Twins and sending right-hander Adam Warren to the Seattle Mariners in separate deals Monday.The trades bring to five the number of deals General Manager Brian Cashman has made involving pitchers in the last week, including acquiring starter J.A. Happ, reliever Zach Britton and Lynn, who could be used in either role, while sending away Chasen Shreve, who was dealt to St. Louis on Sunday, and Warren, who goes to a Mariners squad that is trying to upgrade its bullpen as it competes for a playoff berth.Cashman may not be done dealing before Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline. The Yankees are trying to stay within reach of the Boston Red Sox even though Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez are expected to be out until at least mid-August. The Yankees did not play on Monday, but they were five and one-half games behind the Red Sox before Boston’s game against Philadelphia. The Yankees begin a four-game series on Thursday at Fenway Park.The three pitchers the Yankees have acquired — Happ, Britton and Lynn — are all free agents this off-season, and came at a modest price. The deal for Lynn cost the Yankees two minor leaguers: first baseman Tyler Austin, who has been unable to carve out a niche on the major league roster, and Luis Rijo, a right-handed pitcher at Class-A Tampa.Lynn is 7-8 with a 5.18 earned run average, easily the worst season of his career. He has pitched better of late, with two solid starts against the Red Sox in the last six weeks, allowing two earned runs in 11 innings, though he did allow nine hits and six walks.The Twins are picking up about half of the nearly $4 million remaining on Lynn’s contract, according to a baseball official who was not authorized to discuss the deal. In exchange for Warren, who is 0-1 with a 2.70 E.R.A. in 30 appearances, the Yankees acquired international bonus pool money.Warren’s remaining salary (about $1 million) will be picked up by the Mariners, leaving the Yankees about $5 million under the $197 million luxury tax threshold. Hal Steinbrenner, the team’s principal owner, wants to stay under that threshold so the team can avoid increased tax penalties if it goes over next season.', 'With Trades, Yankees Pitching Staff Remains a Work in Progress - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/sports/nick-saban-alabama.html': ('The start of the college football season is mere weeks away, and fans begging for Nick Saban’s Alabama Crimson Tide to backslide do not have a lot to pin their hopes on.The Crimson Tide have won five national championships since 2009 and they are expected to have their usual array of talent on both sides of the ball and special teams in 2018. There is something of a quarterback controversy between the junior Jalen Hurts, who led the team to the last two national championship games, and the sophomore Tua Tagovailoa, who rescued the team after halftime of last season’s championship game against Georgia. It is a luxurious problem for Saban to solve.There is this though: Saban has six new assistant coaches. Brent Key, an offensive line coach, is the only assistant in the same role as 2017. Saban also has a new offensive coordinator and new defensive coordinator. Running backs coach Burton Burns, the last remaining assistant coach from Saban’s first Alabama staff, retired from coaching in January. Mike Locksley is Saban’s seventh offensive coordinator at Alabama.In this era of the college football coach as chief executive — fund-raiser, spokesman, visionary — staff turnover like this would be an impediment for some coaches, but not for Saban. He has managed similar situations before, cycling through 39 assistants since arriving at Alabama in 2007 while winning at an absurd pace (132-20). Perhaps it is because Saban has figured out how to be a different kind of leader — a very hands-on C.E.O.Bobby Bowden, who was the head coach at Florida State for 34 years, said when he started to lose assistant coaches, F.S.U. went from national title contender to “above average.” Chuck Amato became head coach at North Carolina State in 2000, Mark Richt, became the head coach at Georgia in 2001, and Bowden’s longtime assistant, Jim Gladden, retired after the 2001 season. F.S.U. had no Top 10 finishes during Bowden’s last seven seasons.“All of them leaving took a piece out of the pie,” Bowden said. “The worst we did was seven wins, but it was enough to get me fired, which goes back to the question of why doesn’t the same thing happen with Saban?”The answer, Saban’s former assistants say, rests with his unchanging belief in big ideas like structure and consistency.“Everything within the culture is clearly defined, your role, your job, and when somebody new comes in, Alabama just rolls out the playbook about what it takes to be successful coaching that position,” said Geoff Collins, the head coach at Temple, who was Saban’s first player personnel director at Alabama. “You stick with the process. There are no competing philosophies.”South Carolina head coach Will Muschamp, who was an assistant under Saban at Louisiana State from 2001-04, said Saban cultivates a vertical, top-down culture. “There is one message in that program,” he said.When offensive coordinator Major Applewhite left Alabama for Texas following the 2007 season, Collins said he and then-sports information director Jeff Purinton were instructed by Saban to put together a binder that listed attributes Saban wanted in an assistant coach. Using the guidelines, Collins and Purinton assembled a list of candidates for the binder. It included Jim McElwain, who was eventually hired and called plays for two Alabama national championship teams (2009, 2011).“He knows what the right fit is for an assistant, but he is also very good on trends and where things are headed and staying ahead and constantly evaluating people in the field,” said McElwain, the wide receivers coach at Michigan. “When he does have turnover he is ahead of what he needs in the organization.”Saban hears complaints about his large ancillary staff — his “analysts” — but he employs so many, he said, to cultivate a pool of candidates to choose from when he has an opening. Mike Groh, the offensive coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles, was one of those analysts who became a full-time Alabama assistant coach.“I’d rather hire somebody that I know as a person in terms of who they are, kind of character they have, kind of leadership they demonstrate, the kind of teacher they can be, rather than having to go on somebody else’s recommendation,” Saban said, at the media event for the Southeastern Conference two weeks ago.To vet new hires McElwain said, Saban finds coaches who already have relationships in certain areas of the country, which is important in recruiting.“That’s 100 percent part of the hiring process,” McElwain said.At SEC Media Days, Anfernee Jennings, a 2018 starting linebacker, was asked to assess the difference between 2017 defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt, and his replacement, Tosh Lupoi. “It’s going to be much of the same thing, just a different person calling it.” Jennings said.To be sure, Alabama has other structural advantages that could cancel out the disadvantage of its sweeping staff overhaul. The Crimson Tide generally have more good players than any other program in the SEC (53 draft picks the last six seasons, 15 in the first round). Also, the SEC has lost some of its finest coaches in the Saban era — Florida’s Urban Meyer is now at Ohio State, South Carolina’s Steve Spurrier is retired, L.S.U.’s Les Miles got fired after failing to match the big red rival. Their replacements have been no match for Saban so far.In the last two years, impatient fans and boosters have forced school presidents to replace three coaches in the SEC’s Western Division, who were not able to compete with Saban (Texas A&M’s Kevin Sumlin, Arkansas’ Bret Bielema and Miles). A fourth coach, Mississippi’s Hugh Freeze, was fired for reasons related to trying to keep up with Alabama: N.C.A.A. recruiting violations. Since 2012, every school in the SEC, besides Alabama, has replaced its head coach, which means those schools have their own staff turnover to manage.Schools trying to compete with Saban invariably take a step back attempting a big step forward, which is similar to what is happening in the N.F.L.’s A.F.C. East. Owners fire coaches failing to catch Saban’s friend, Bill Belichick, who has coached the New England Patriots since 2000.“That’s one of the amazing things about Saban,” Bowden said. “He doesn’t just lose a good man, he loses good men, and I don’t see any shortage of the number of quality players and how they play. I’ve tried to figure out why, why, why.”', 'Nick Saban Has Six New Assistants at Alabama — and Will Probably Still Win - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/sports/basketball/lebron-james-akron-school.html': ('LeBron James the basketball player has left Ohio. But on Monday morning, the footprint of LeBron James, the philanthropist, got even bigger in his home state.The I Promise School, started in conjunction with James’s foundation and Akron Public Schools, opened Monday for 240 third- and fourth-grade students. The school will add grade levels each academic year, and by 2022 is expected to educate children in first through eighth grades.Much has been written about James’s turbulent childhood in Akron, Ohio. In fourth grade, for example, he missed more than 16 weeks worth of school days. The LeBron James Family Foundation sought a way to help families like the one he grew up in, providing children with an education, a path to college and support services for them and their parents.“We are going to be that groundbreaking school that will be a nationally recognized model for urban and public school excellence,” I Promise principal and Akron native Brandi Davis told USA Today. “We are letting people know it is about true wrap-around support, true family integration and true compassion.”Students were selected for the inaugural class based on their academic history.“Looking at reading data, we identified students who were a year, two years behind in reading,” Keith Liechty, the Akron Public Schools’ liaison to James’ foundation, told the newspaper. “From that, we had more than 120 kids. We had to put a cap on it so we could fit under one roof. We did a random selection of all students who met that criteria and got to make these awesome phone calls to parents and say, ‘How would you like to be part of something different, the I Promise School.’”James moved from the hometown Cleveland Cavaliers to the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency this off-season. Still, a big chunk of his heart is in Akron. On Sunday, James, 33, tweeted this:“The jitters before the first day of school are real right now!!!

In 58 Italian league games over three seasons, he had scored seven goals.But upon his arrival in the United States, Martinez almost immediately began finding the net, and Atlanta quickly executed its option to buy him permanently for about $5 million. He was limited by two injury spells to 20 games, but he powered in 19 goals. That ranked him fourth in the league, behind three players who played 30 or more games each. His team overachieved as well, making a trip to the playoffs in its inaugural season.This season, he’s having the opposite of a sophomore slump. Martinez has appeared in all 23 league games for Atlanta and he has kept up the dizzying goal-a-game pace, scoring 24. He towers over the top of the leader board, nine goals ahead of runner-up Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the L.A. Galaxy. He also leads the table with eight game-winning goals.His six career hat tricks, in a season and a half of play, are already the M.L.S. record. And he is closing in on a more venerable mark. Roy Lassiter scored 27 goals for the now-defunct Tampa Bay Mutiny in 1996. The mark has been matched twice, by Chris Wondolowski in 2012 and Bradley Wright-Phillips in 2014, but never exceeded. Barring injury or a catastrophic loss of form, Martinez should obliterate it.Martinez has a near William Tell-like accuracy: 65 percent of his shots are on goal, the best rate among the top 10 scorers, most of whom are under 50 percent. He also has a knack for scoring headers, despite being only 5-foot-7, thanks to his leaping ability.Some of the credit for Martinez’s prolific scoring has gone to Gerardo Martino, the team’s coach. He arrived in Atlanta with a glittering resume that included stints at Barcelona and the Argentine national team, and lived up to it by guiding United to instant success. Perhaps sensing he had a goal scorer on his hands, he also shifted Martinez to center forward.“Josef came here without really playing much as a center forward before,” he told Univision. “He came here and adapted very well, and that can be seen.”And Atlanta is exceeding last year’s maiden performance; the team has the best record in the league.Averaging a goal per game is the Holy Grail for a striker, and is extraordinarily difficult to achieve. It’s never happened in Major League Soccer, and no leading scorer has managed it since the creation of the Premier League. In Spain, the feat has been achieved only by the greats: recently, Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi.Though Martinez is still only 25 he probably won’t ever get to face off against those or other top players in a World Cup. He hails from Venezuela, the rare South American country where baseball is king. It has never made a World Cup and placed 10th of 10 in qualifying for the 2018 event.You also might not see Martinez in the M.L.S. for long. His scoring has prompted much speculation that he will be bound for a big European team in the near future, though he told SB Nation, “I live in the present. I don’t think about the future. So right now I’m happy in Atlanta.”If he does go, he may set another record, for largest M.L.S. transfer.

The posts are from 2011 and 2012.The 25-year-old Turner said there is no excuse for his language and he is “sincerely sorry for those tweets and apologize wholeheartedly.”“I believe people who know me understand those regrettable actions do not reflect my values or who I am,” he said in a statement issued by the team. “But I understand the hurtful nature of such language and am sorry to have brought any negative light to the Nationals organization, myself or the game I love.”Atlanta Braves pitcher Sean Newcomb also apologized Sunday for racist, homophobic and sexist tweets he sent as a teenager, calling them “some stupid stuff.” Major League Baseball dealt with a similar situation this month involving Milwaukee Brewers reliever Josh Hader on the night he pitched in the All-Star Game.Mike Rizzo, the president of baseball operations for the Nationals, said he spoke with Turner about the issue.“He understands that his comments — regardless of when they were posted — are inexcusable and is taking full responsibility for his actions,” Rizzo said in a separate statement released by the team.“The Nationals organization does not condone discrimination in any form, and his comments in no way reflect the values of our club. Trea has been a good teammate and model citizen in our clubhouse, and these comments are not indicative of how he has conducted himself while part of our team.

If that were not bad enough, the team that acquired him then bought out his contract and released him.Weeks later, the same situation is playing out for another certain Hall of Famer. We are, of course, talking about Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony, two players as polarizing as they are accomplished. For much of their careers, they were in the game’s highest tier, widely considered to be top 10 players, if not top five. Despite being healthy and well short of typical retirement age, they are now treated mostly as afterthoughts. Welcome to the new N.B.A.“If something doesn't work, go ahead and get a buyout or go ahead and get traded,” Anthony told reporters on Thursday in justifying his treatment. “That’s the new norm in our society in basketball. I had to get over that.”The messy way the careers of Howard and Anthony are wrapping up has inspired some fierce online debate about their Hall of Fame credentials. Their résumés may be packed with accomplishments (if not championship rings), but for fans with short memories, Howard and Anthony’s future induction is being treated as an open question.To be clear: Any debate about either player borders on ridiculous. By the statistic Hall of Fame probability, which is compiled by Basketball-Reference, Howard has a 99.3 percent chance of Hall of Fame induction and Anthony is just behind him at 98.2 percent. No single statistic can explain an entire career, but the Basketball-Reference model, which accounts for a player’s height, N.B.A. championships, appearances on N.B.A. leaderboards, win shares at a player’s peak and All-Star selections, has a good track record of accuracy. Of the 113 players given a 50 percent or greater chance of enshrinement, 89 have reached Hall of Fame eligibility. Of that group, 85 have been inducted. Only Larry Foust, a center for the Fort Wayne Pistons in the 1950s, was given a greater than 90 percent chance of induction without making the Hall. With that in mind, an interesting experiment is to build a starting five of players who are going to be Hall of Famers someday — barring a criminal conviction or revelations about gambling or on-court cheating — but still manage to find themselves having their credentials litigated by fans who seem desperate to knock them down a few pegs. Hall of Fame probability: 99.3 percentCredentials: The No. 1 overall pick in the 2004 draft, Howard went on to be a three-time defensive player of the year and was named to eight All-N.B.A. teams. He has career averages of 17.4 points, 12.7 rebounds and 2 blocks a game, and at his peak, he was a singular force on both ends of the court and a slam dunk contest champion. His outgoing personality was at one time seen as a strength.The case against him: A back injury made his prime somewhat less spectacular than it might have been, but his journeyman status late in his career is more about his personality and salary than it is about his play on the court, which has remained exceptional. His tumultuous exit from Orlando, including a particularly cringe-worthy episode involving a public embrace of Stan Van Gundy, the coach he was trying to get fired, seems to be the sticking point for many people, along with his lack of championship rings.Backup: Pau Gasol (93.4 percent chance of induction)Hall of Fame probability: 99.5 percentCredentials: Bosh was a pioneering small-ball center for the Miami Heat during two championship runs after joining forces with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in what came to be known as the Flying Death Machine. He excelled on both ends of the court and was one of the few players who truly meant it when he said he would sacrifice personal statistics to win championships. Even if his numbers do not tell a complete story, he was still named to 11 consecutive All-Star Games, won a gold medal and averaged 19.2 points and 8.5 rebounds in a 13-year career that ended when he was 31 because of medical problems. That he was reasserting himself as a superstar in Miami after James’s departure made his early exit even more frustrating.The case against him: Seen by many as the weakest link in the Big Three — not that many players could stand up to a comparison to James and Wade — Bosh did not dominate in a flashy way, and his years of being the best player for the Toronto Raptors were quickly forgotten by those who chose to view him as a role player.Backup: Kevin Love (67.6 percent chance of induction)Hall of Fame probability: 98.2 percentCredentials: The 22nd leading scorer in N.B.A. history, Anthony led Syracuse to an N.C.A.A. championship, was a key player and leader of three gold-medal-winning Olympic teams and was named to 10 All-Star teams and six All-N.B.A. teams. He has career averages of 24.1 points and 6.5 rebounds a game.The case against him: Never a model of efficiency, even on offense, Anthony has most often been questioned for a lack of defensive effort. He also gets dinged for his clashes with several coaches and teammates. His teams have made the playoffs 11 times, but have advanced to the second round just twice and the conference finals just once. Backup: Beyond Vince Carter, who has spent more time at shooting guard than small forward, there isn’t another small forward to compete with Anthony for this spot.Hall of Fame probability: 94.6 percentCredentials: He jumped over the head of a 7-foot-2 center for a dunk during the 2000 Olympics. He was also named to eight All-Star teams, won a Rookie of the Year Award, won a slam dunk contest and averaged 25 or more points a game in four different seasons (and 17.7 points a game for the entirety of his career, which is at 20 years). And it should be mentioned again that he jumped over the head of a 7-foot-2 center for a dunk during the 2000 Olympics.The case against him: His explosive start in Toronto, which extended into his time with the Nets, gave way to a much quieter latter half of his career, in which he dunked less and played more with his head than his body. He has also never advanced beyond the conference finals.Backup: Joe Johnson (50.6 percent chance of induction)Hall of Fame probability: 99.9 percentCredentials: Paul is widely regarded as one of the finest point guards to step on a court. He has been named to eight All-N.B.A. teams, nine All-Star teams and nine all-defensive teams; won a Rookie of the Year Award; led the N.B.A. in steals six times and in assists four times; and he has two Olympic gold medals. He even managed a late-career surprise by seamlessly fitting into Coach Mike D’Antoni’s system in Houston, raising the Rockets from a good team to the only legitimate challenger to the Golden State Warriors in the N.B.A. And he’s not done yet. The case against him: Until last season, Paul’s teams had never advanced to a conference final, let alone an N.B.A. finals, and many considered that a failure that landed on his shoulders as the Clippers had talent to spare in several of his seasons in Los Angeles. Backups: Russell Westbrook (99.1 percent chance of induction), Tony Parker (93.9 percent). \", 'Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard Are Hall of Famers. No Matter What Twitter Says. - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/sports/baseball/hall-of-fame-induction.html': ('COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. — Chipper Jones was a minor leaguer when he first met Jim Thome. It was during a melee, Jones recalled on Sunday when both players were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.“What felt like the hand of God grabbed me by the throat, pinned me to the netting of the backstop and said, ‘Don’t move,’ ” Jones said from the induction stage. With the brawl still going, Thome turned to Jones and asked, “You done?” Yes, Jones told the brawnier Thome, he was done.On a sun-splashed day at the Clark Sports Center a few minutes from the Hall of Fame, Jones and Thome were inducted along with Vladimir Guerrero, Trevor Hoffman, Jack Morris and Alan Trammell.“I didn’t think this day would ever come,” said Trammell, the Detroit Tigers shortstop for 20 years who, like Morris, was voted in by the Modern Era committee after the Baseball Writers Association of America did not elect him in his 15 years of eligibility.Morris, with a reputation as a big-game pitcher, offered a variation on Trammell’s sentiment.“Whether you voted for me or not,” he later said to the writers who gave him enough support to last a full 15 years on their ballot but not enough to elect him, “thank you for keeping my name alive.”Fifty-one members of the Hall joined the six new inductees. Hank Aaron used a cane to walk to his seat, while Rod Carew moved with a new briskness since his heart transplant nearly two years ago. But others who usually attend were absent, such as Sandy Koufax, Tom Seaver, Bob Gibson and Orlando Cepeda.The 53,000 fans who turned out for the annual celebration spread out on the meadow. Guerrero fans chanted “Vladi!” and wore the jerseys of his first team, the Montreal Expos, and the team he won a Most Valuable Player Award for, the Angels.Several families, from toddlers to teenagers, dressed in replicas of Thome’s Cleveland Indians and White Sox uniforms.Atlanta Braves fans performed the tomahawk chop in Jones’s honor.And Detroit fans shouted, “Let’s Go Tigers!” as Trammell approached the podium for his speech.“I hear you,” he said before describing how he received the news of his election while waiting to disembark from an airplane. “I wanted to jump up and yell and scream; I didn’t feel it was appropriate to do it in the aisle of an airplane,” although the pilot might have forgiven him.For each inductee, the speech is an amalgam of gratitude (to parents, coaches, managers, general managers, teammates, scouts, neighbors, spouses, children and fans), origin story (how they were inspired to play and leapt from minor-league promise to major league stardom), storytelling and emotion.It is a delicate balance that Guerrero — the third Dominican player elected to the Hall — did not attempt. The preternaturally great bad-ball hitter spoke for a few minutes in Spanish, thanking Mike Scioscia, the Angels’ manager, and Felipe Alou, his manager with the Expos, while noting that Sunday was Father’s Day in the Dominican Republic.“Happy Father’s Day to all the Dominican pops!” he said cheerfully through the translator Jose Mota.Some inductees cry (Morris choked up but did not break down as Bill Mazeroski did).Some overthank (Frank Thomas set a record for extreme gratitude even after dramatically paring his oration).Some mix humor with pride in their homeland (Pedro Martinez, the second Dominican player in the Hall after Juan Marichal).And nearly all preach humility. Hoffman, the closer whose 601 saves were eventually exceeded by Mariano Rivera, ladled his speech with motivational phrases from John Wooden, the former U.C.L.A. men’s basketball coach known for his meditations on success.“Things turn out the best for the people who make the best out of the way things turn out,” said Hoffman, who played primarily with the San Diego Padres. He added: “Talent is God-given. Be humble. Fame is man-made. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful.”Trammell said that he was tutored by his mother “to be as humble as her favorite player, Stan Musial.”And addressing youngsters in the crowd, Thome said: “Above all, treat people with respect. The best compliment a ballplayer can hear is that he’s a great teammate.”Trammell talked about the teammate to whom he is indelibly linked — Lou Whitaker, a second baseman, who in his only year of B.B.W.A.A. eligibility received only 2.9 percent of the vote and fell off the ballot. Trammell and Whitaker became Tigers at the same time and formed one of the greatest double play combinations in baseball history over their 19 years together. But Trammell is in the Hall, and Whitaker is not.“It’s my hope,” Trammell said, looking at Whitaker in the audience, “that you’ll be up here someday.”Thome might have had the best day of the six inductees. The slugger who hit 612 home runs was able to watch his daughter, Lila, sing the national anthem, and he could look at his father, Chuck, and talk about their previous trip to Cooperstown when they delivered the ball that he hit for his 500th home run.“But,” Thome said, “I’m guessing you think this is a bit more special.”', 'Newest Hall of Famers Carry Records and Memories Into Cooperstown - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/sports/ja-happ-yankees-royals.html': ('Yankee Stadium can be an extremely inhospitable place to play. The fans can be demanding, unforgiving and downright rude.And that’s just for the home team.So it was understandable that when J. A. Happ took the mound on Sunday for the first time in Yankee pinstripes, his heart was pumping a little harder than usual despite his 12 years of experience and 248 major league starts.After all, Tino Martinez and Jason Giambi had been welcomed with boos, and this year, Giancarlo Stanton, the reigning National League most valuable player, had been subjected to what seems to be a Bronx rite of passage.Just a day before Happ’s debut, Zach Britton, a top closer who saved 120 games over a three-year period for the Baltimore Orioles, was booed heavily for allowing a run in a game the Yankees won.Imagine the pressure, then, on a pitcher acquired during the past week for the express purpose of solidifying the one unit on the Yankees in need of fortification: its starting rotation. Happ felt it.“I’d be lying if I said I didn’t,” Happ said. “They traded for you, so there’s some pressure in that. You definitely want to have good results.”And the verdict? “I feel like I handled it all right,” he said.Happ’s response was as understated as his outing. He worked six innings, allowed one run on three hits, walked one and struck out two. It was precisely the type of no-drama performance that the Yankees needed in cruising to a 6-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals, completing a series in which they won three of four games.Happ’s workmanlike outing earned what may be the highest praise in the Southern California-inflected lexicon of Manager Aaron Boone, who referred to his newest player as “a significant dude to our rotation.”And catcher Austin Romine, who barely had time for more than a perfunctory pregame meeting with Happ, looked incredulous when informed that the 35-year-old left-hander had admitted being nervous before the game.“Happ?” Romine said. “If he was, I couldn’t see it. Not even a little bit. I thought it was business as usual.”Happ’s efficiency was the perfect antidote to the unease after Luis Severino’s rocky outing in the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader and the uncertainty that has continued to surround Sonny Gray despite some recent improvement.Bolstered by a three-hit day by Aaron Hicks, who had a first-inning home run, a double, a single and two runs batted in, Happ had space to work through some early butterflies. He allowed a first-inning single to Salvador Perez and then settled down to hold the Royals hitless until the sixth, which Rosell Herrera led off with a single that was quickly erased on a double play.Later in the inning, Happ allowed his only run of the day, a solo homer by Perez, who terrorized Yankees pitchers all weekend with seven hits in 16 at-bats, including three home runs. The only way Happ’s day could have gone better was if he had been removed in the middle of an inning and left the game to the ovation he would have surely received.The Yankees were leading, 6-1, when Happ left. Relievers Chad Green and David Robertson allowed solo home runs to Hunter Dozier and Herrera — the 25-year-old Herrera’s first major league homer — but Aroldis Chapman struck out the side in the ninth, earning his 28th save of the season.“It was kind of weird looking down and seeing the pinstripes on me, but I’m happy to get used to it,” Happ said. “You’re in a pennant race, and that’s the most exciting thing in baseball, so that’s why I had some of those nerves in the first inning. It was a little surreal out there, but a lot of fun.”The Yankees acquired Happ from the fourth-place Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday in exchange for third baseman Brandon Drury and outfielder Billy McKinney, both of whom were playing in the minor leagues. In Happ, the team gained a big-league performance from a pitcher with a 103-82 career record and a 3.94 E.R.A. who has been a 20-game winner and an All-Star. Happ also pitched in a World Series for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009, when they lost to the Yankees.His stuff is not eye-popping, but he throws strikes and is not afraid to pitch inside, and according to Romine, his smooth delivery makes his 93-mile-per-hour fastball appear much faster. “I remember from hitting against him that his ball gets on you in a hurry,” Romine said. “And I saw that again today.”Happ was hardly the sexiest name among the available starting pitchers as Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline loomed, but for the Yankees’ purposes, he may turn out to be ideal; his next start is scheduled for Fenway Park on Friday against the Boston Red Sox, whom the Yankees trail by five and a half games in the American League East.Happ has a 7-4 record and a 2.98 E.R.A. in 18 career starts against the Red Sox, but over the past three seasons, he is 4-1 with a 1.84 E.R.A., and this season he has allowed just one earned run over 10 ⅔ innings while striking out 16. At Fenway, the numbers are 4-2 and 2.91.“It was fun watching him do his thing, and the pace that he works at,” Boone said. “He’s just get it and go. Just seeing him coming in here with that intensity, that focus, just looking so comfortable and already fitting in so well, you can see he’s going to be really important for us in the second half.”Happ not only won the game, he won over the tough Yankee Stadium crowd. And sometimes, that can be the toughest victory of all.', 'J.A. Happ Avoids a Bronx Cheer by Leading the Yankees to Victory - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/sports/baseball/zack-wheeler-leads-mets-over-pirates.html': ('PITTSBURGH — Zack Wheeler did not receive much help on offense. Luckily for the Mets, Wheeler was prepared to help himself.Wheeler, a right-hander, pitched six strong innings and drove in the lone run, leading the Mets to a 1-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday.“I think being successful definitely helps,” Wheeler said. “I have the same confidence, or same demeanor, but when you’re getting guys out on a consistent basis and doing what you want to do pitch by pitch, then it makes it a lot easier and fun.”Wheeler (5-6) allowed five hits with seven strikeouts and one walk, and got his fourth R.B.I. of the season on a double in the fifth. He won a third straight start after giving up a combined six runs in 14 ⅔ innings over his last two.Mets Manager Mickey Callaway was impressed.“He’s just steady as he can be these days, so it’s fun to get to run him out there every five days,” Callaway said.He added: “The way he’s attacking hitters now, he knows his stuff is good. He knows he’s going to beat them. That makes for the most effective pitcher.”The Mets split the four-game series with the Pirates, who lost for just the fourth time in their last 19 games.The right-handed reliever Anthony Swarzak retired the side in order, striking out two, in the ninth for his third save.As much as he enjoyed shutting out Pittsburgh through six, Wheeler said he was more proud of his double. It helped his own cause after Luis Guillorme singled with two outs. Wheeler sent a drive off Joe Musgrove (4-5) over right fielder Gregory Polanco, scoring Guillorme from second.“It was a fun battle,” Musgrove said. “It was a pitcher’s duel for the most part of the game. I think he probably feels pretty good right now being able to win the game himself with the big double there. It was well-pitched game on both sides.”Musgrove did not allow a hit until the fifth, when he gave up a leadoff single to Austin Jackson before the hits from Guillorme and Wheeler. Two Mets reached base in the first four innings: Jackson walked in the second, and Brandon Nimmo was hit by a pitch in the fourth.After going at least seven innings in each of his previous two starts, Musgrove went seven again and gave up five hits with two strikeouts and two walks.Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle said that Musgrove “has an edge to everything he does, adding, “Everybody’s going to love playing behind a guy that works quick and gets outs.”The Pirates had hits in five of the first six innings, including each of the first four. Gregory Polanco, who was 3 for 4 with two steals, was left stranded at second twice when David Freese flied out to right in the first and Elias Diaz grounded out to short in the sixth.Inside PitchAustin Jackson, who was 2 for 3 with a walk, started for the first time since the Mets acquired him Friday. He struck out in his first appearance for the Mets, a pinch-hit at-bat in a 5-4 loss Friday. In 59 games with the San Francisco Giants this season, Jackson hit .242 with 13 R.B.I.', 'Zack Wheeler Provides the Defense, and Offense, the Mets Need - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/sports/azmi-sisters-ball-hockey.html': ('MISSISSAUGA, Ontario — The six Azmi sisters are a starting lineup unto themselves.They could be seen as ball hockey’s answer to the Sutter family, which sent six brothers to the N.H.L. But these hijab-wearing Muslim players in the summer league of the Toronto Women’s Ball Hockey Association — Asiyah, 25; Nuha, 23; Husnah, 21; Sajidah, 18; Haleemah, 17; and Mubeenah, 14 — are much more than that.Like Nazem Kadri, the first Muslim player to be drafted by the N.H.L.’s Toronto Maple Leafs, the sisters are forcing many sports fans to expand their view of who can go hard to the net.“People are clearly embracing them,” said Judy Ilcio, who founded the women’s league in 1983. “This truly is the next evolution of who we’ve become in ball hockey.”The sport is similar to ice hockey — but without the ice and skates. The players in the Toronto women’s league wear helmets, face masks, shin pads, hockey gloves and sneakers as they whack a plastic ball over a concrete floor with a hockey stick. Body checking is illegal, but incidental contact is not.The Azmi sisters have been featured on the Maple Leafs’ online fan network and were the subject of popular videos produced by Canadian Tire during the Winter Olympics. Still, some people are taken aback when they see the Azmis with their hockey sticks in their hijabs.“A lot of people see religious Muslims who observe, so a lot of them are surprised when they see that you’re actually like everyone else,” Husnah Azmi said.Even in hot conditions, intensified by the hijabs under their helmets, the Azmi sisters display a love of ball hockey that has endeared them to others in the league and to prominent ice hockey personalities such as Kadri and Hayley Wickenheiser, a four-time Olympic gold medalist.In one of the Canadian Tire videos, which have the slogan “We All Play for Canada,” Wickenheiser surprises the sisters from the Winter Games in South Korea.“The sisters embraced a new culture in a way that was unique and authentic to them,” said Eva Salem, Canadian Tire’s vice president of marketing. “We really were trying to find real people who sort of embodied the values of inclusivity, sportsmanship and selflessness.”The sisters’ influence goes beyond the arena. A local school board asked them to speak at a women’s empowerment conference, and they gave a presentation about their experiences playing hockey as observant Muslim women.Canada has more than one million Muslims, with more than 400,000 living in the greater Toronto area. Muslim athletes have typically gravitated to soccer and basketball, but many have started playing ice hockey and ball hockey.In addition to the six Azmi sisters, there are about 20 other Muslims who play in the Toronto Women’s Ball Hockey Association, which has around 200 players.“You need people to pave the way, and to show it’s not impossible,” said Kadri, arguably this country’s most famous Muslim athlete. “Now you look at these younger kids, and there’s so much diversity in the sport of hockey, and it’s really fulfilling to see.”Kadri’s team is a popular one in the Azmi home. The sisters’ bedroom, which they share, is furnished with Maple Leafs collectibles and novelty items, from pillows to bedsheets to trinkets.The sisters play together on two separate teams within the league: the Red team in the East Division and the White team in the West. Both are middle of the road clubs in the standings, and only one of the sisters — the 17-year-old Haleemah — ranks in the top 15 in scoring.But their value goes beyond raw statistics, and that’s why the league made a special accommodation for them early in the season, moving their games a couple of hours later during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, during which the sisters fast until the sun goes down. They also pray five times a day.Playing when the sun was down meant the sisters could drink water and snack on home-cooked samosas to keep their energy up and prevent dehydration.“The girls asked, and I didn’t think twice about doing it,” Beth Brotherstone, the league president, said. “They love to play the game, they have a great attitude, they’re awesome people and represent the community very well.”The Azmi family includes three brothers — Yusef, 29; Salih, 28; and Tayyib, 15 — who grew up playing ice hockey. The sisters also played soccer, volleyball and basketball. They learned how to skate, but, as they shared during their surprise talk with Wickenheiser, they had one problem: They didn’t know how to stop, they admitted with giggles.Their parents, Shaheen and Fara, could not afford to suit them all up for ice hockey, but they could afford the $180 registration fee in ball hockey.Ice hockey was their father’s love. Shaheen Azmi, who is from Pakistan, still has a vague memory of watching the Maple Leafs win what is still the team’s most recent Stanley Cup championship, in 1967.His family did not have the money to put him into ice hockey, so he, too, turned his attention to pickup ball hockey in gyms or on the street.He began working for the Ontario Human Rights Commission after finishing his Ph.D. in social work. Shaheen Azmi was always concerned about racism and discrimination in Canadian society, and he felt that working at the commission would be a natural fit.“We knew our rights growing up,” said Asiyah Azmi, who works as a legal assistant.And as athletes, the young women are winning respect for their commitment to the game.“They’re sweet,” said Sue Smith, one of their opponents. “They know what they’re doing, and they have tons of energy. You think, culturally, they aren’t going to be fast, but they break that barrier completely.”Another opponent, Michelle Rosenberg, recalled her stunned reaction the first time she was in the same dressing room with five of the sisters, during a charity tournament. Rosenberg admitted she had a preconceived notion that Muslim women were supposed to be solemn, conservative and deferential.“They came bursting in and started talking all at once and arguing with one another,” Rosenberg said. “I thought, this doesn’t seem right. But if they were five white young women, no one would look the other way.”Rosenberg was also in for a surprise on the floor, because the sisters had honed their skills — and weren’t the least bit deferential — on the street and in their Toronto driveway.“That was another thing that made us want to improve, to represent Muslim women in a better light and show that we were capable of being competitors,” said Husnah Azmi, who is working toward a master’s degree in environmental applied science and management.Social media is not as welcoming as their opponents on the floors have come to be, but the sisters laugh off some of the comments.“They told us to go back where we came from,” Nuha Azmi said, as an example. “But we’re not immigrants. We were born here. But we’re not angry. It’s coming from a place where they don’t know better.”The arena is their protected zone. When the six Azmi women arrive en masse, usually talking up a storm and carrying on like, well, sisters, everyone is instantly aware of their presence.“Everybody here just refers to them as the girls, or the sisters,” said Brotherstone, the league president. “I just call them my rock stars.”', 'The Azmi Sisters Go Hard in Ball Hockey.

The attempts to unbalance riders during the most grueling climbs.Geraint Thomas never flinched at whatever fans — or his rivals — threw at him or at Team Sky.Thomas was the steadiest cyclist from the start and remained the strongest in the Alps and the Pyrenees. On Sunday, he concluded his transformation from a support rider to a champion of cycling’s biggest race, claiming his first Tour de France title.“With the boys, that’s the main thing for the whole three weeks: We stuck together through some tough times, stayed strong,” said Thomas, a Welshman who is the third rider from Britain to win the race. “Everything just clicked this race.”Thomas maintained his lead of 1 minute 51 seconds over Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands in the mostly ceremonial final stage.The four-time champion Chris Froome, Thomas’s teammate, finished third, 2:24 behind. Froome rode next to Thomas and applauded as they crossed the line.Thomas was a support rider during Froome’s four victories, but he emerged as Sky’s strongest rider in this race after Froome crashed early and could not keep up in the mountains.Team Sky — and consequently Thomas — became a target for many fans because of an asthma-drug case involving Froome, stemming from last year’s Vuelta a España. Froome was cleared of doping charges days before the start of the Tour, but that did not stop some fans from abusing the British team’s riders throughout the three-week race.“When there is negativity like that, it brings us as a team closer together,” Froome said, adding, “You can choose to let it get to you or you can choose to let it motivate you, and we let it motivate us.”Thomas stormed into the lead after winning back-to-back mountain stages in the Alps, including the climb up Alpe d’Huez, then defended his advantage in the Pyrenees.During the podium ceremony, Thomas draped the flag of Wales over his shoulders and ended his victory speech with a strong statement.“All I can say is that I do it the right way,” Thomas said when asked about allegations of doping within Sky. “We train super hard, and there’s nothing I can say that will prove it. I’ve just got to keep doing what I’m doing. It will stand the test of time.”An all-around rider who began his career on the track, Thomas, 32, helped Britain win gold medals in team pursuit at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics before turning his full attention to road racing.On Sunday, he rode a yellow bicycle to match his yellow jersey, sharing glasses of champagne with his teammates during the casual ride into Paris before buckling down to keep up with the other leaders on the jarring cobblestones of the Champs-Élysées.“It’s going to take a while to sink in,” Thomas said. “Normally that stage is really hard, but today I just seemed to float around it. I had goose bumps going around there.”The Norwegian rider Alexander Kristoff of UAE Team Emirates won the final stage in a sprint finish.“I’ve dreamed about this victory for many years,” Kristoff said. “I’ve been close many times before but never managed to beat the faster guys.”The mostly flat leg of about 72 miles began in Houilles just outside Paris and concluded with nine laps up and down the Champs-Élysées.Many spectators along the Champs-Élysées held their phones high to record the riders as they went past on the cobblestones, and there were more cheers when 11 planes flew overhead, leaving trails in the blue, white and red colors of the French flag.Glenn Roberts, from Newtown, Wales, was there with his wife and children. The family timed its summer vacation to coincide with the Tour’s finish.“Thomas was in the yellow when we left Wales, but we didn’t know if he was going to keep it,” Roberts said. “We thought Froome was going to win it, if I’m being honest.

The longtime Cooperstown resident then attended 64 of the next 67 inductions, including last year’s when he was 99 and a resident of an assisted living facility.He was easy to spot at the Clark Sports Center, handing out business cards bearing reproductions of his photos, and wearing a sign around his neck that said, “I was at the first induction.”But when Jim Thome, Vladimir Guerrero, Chipper Jones, Trevor Hoffman, Jack Morris and Alan Trammell enter the Hall on Sunday, Osterhoudt will not be there. He died last month at 100.“We were all hoping he’d make it to this year’s,” said Cindy Falk, the village’s deputy mayor, a friend from a local Baptist church who visited Osterhoudt during hospice care. “It was so important to him.”Osterhoudt’s son, Darrell, and Darrell’s wife, Priscilla, who live in Virginia, will attend in his place.“We’re going to keep up the tradition, but I don’t know for how long,” Darrell Osterhoudt said by telephone.Homer Osterhoudt’s devotion to the induction ceremonies was not because of a love of baseball. He was, at best, a casual fan without an allegiance to a particular team. But he felt like he was part of the Hall because, as a young man, he helped build it. In 1937, Osterhoudt was hired as a laborer with the Bedford Construction Company and kept working on the Hall through the winter of ’38.“We set up a cement mixing machine in front of the post office on Main Street,” he recalled in 2008 during an interview for an oral history program at the State University of New York, Oneonta. “We carted, wheelbarrowed cement over to the foundation across the street for the Hall of Fame. After they got the foundation done, they put up the building sides with cement blocks and then bricks.”When the hall opened its doors to the first classes of inductees in 1939, Osterhoudt roamed the village taking pictures of them (and other major leaguers) as they arrived, marched in a parade, gathered on a platform in front of the Hall for the induction and played a game at Doubleday Field.“It was quite an event for Cooperstown,” he said in the oral history.Osterhoudt’s snapshots provide a more kinetic view of the events that day than the famous group portrait of 10 of the 11 living inductees (except for Ty Cobb, who was late).From Osterhoudt’s amateur camera emerged images of Ruth delivering his induction remarks, Dizzy Dean warming up for the game at Doubleday Field, and Wagner signing an autograph at the local train station. He also captured Hank Greenberg striding down a village street while fans tried to keep up with him, Cookie Lavagetto and Stan Hack carrying flags in the induction parade, and Johnson leaning over from the induction platform in front of the Hall to sign his name to autograph books and programs.After serving in the Army Air Forces in the South Pacific during World War II, Osterhoudt married Marion Potter, worked as a mail carrier for more than 30 years and served his church and the Boy Scouts. In retirement, he delivered meals to the elderly.“He just thought that’s what you do: you live in a community, you get involved in things,” Darrell Osterhoudt said. “That was just his philosophy. He didn’t think it was unusual.”And he continued to attend nearly every induction. Sometimes he asked Hall of Famers like Ozzie Smith to sign his pictures of them. In 1989, he donated scores of his pictures from 1939 to the Hall, and was later invited to attend an annual discussion at the Hall that commemorates the first induction.“He was a happy guy who loved the Hall of Fame and the people who came to it,” said Jeff Idelson, the president of the Hall. “He realized the impact he had on people who loved the game more than he did.”Brad Horn, a former public relations executive at the Hall, added, “He was the ultimate living Cooperstown attraction, always with a smile and a story.”At the induction four years ago, Osterhoudt reflected on the unexpected fame that longevity had brought him.“Everybody wants to take my picture and wants my autograph,” he told The Parkersburg News and Sentinel of West Virginia. “I guess I am a celebrity. At least that’s what they say.”', 'The House That Homer Built: Remembering a Cooperstown Celebrity - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/sports/yankees-royals-luis-severino.html': ('The Yankees played their first game of Aaron Judge’s extended absence on Saturday. But it is the sudden foundering of their ace, Luis Severino, that could have the club even more concerned.With only a few days left before the nonwaiver trade deadline, Severino, an All-Star and a steady force at the top of the Yankees rotation, was hammered by the American League’s lowest-scoring team, the Kansas City Royals, in a 10-5 loss in the first game of a doubleheader at Yankee Stadium.“It’s not easy for us right now,” Manager Aaron Boone said after the second game, a 5-4 Yankees comeback victory. “We’re going through one of those stretches.”Since June 21, the Yankees are 16-15, with a 7-5 record against teams under .500. It is no coincidence that the stretch of mediocrity has aligned with a slump by Severino, the Yankees’ 24-year-old ace.The Royals, who traded their best hitter, Mike Moustakas, to the Milwaukee Brewers on Friday, jumped on Severino for six runs and eight hits in four and one-third innings.Since shutting down the Boston Red Sox in a scoreless outing on July 1, Severino has an 8.95 earned run average and has allowed 33 hits in 19 1/3 innings. He had allowed 32 hits in his previous 47 1/3 innings.Severino (14-3) said he needed to find a way to “be myself again.”“I don’t know what’s the issue,” he said. “I’ve been through this in the past. I just need to work on the stuff that’s not working.”Lately, it has been hard to pinpoint what exactly has gone awry. In allowing 11 hits and six earned runs against the Tampa Bay Rays on Monday, Severino lacked command of his breaking pitches. On Saturday, his fastball still zipped, but in inconsistent directions.“He was kind of scattered all over the place,” Yankees catcher Austin Romine said. “I was trying to reiterate to him to stay down the zone and throw through me. He was kind of inconsistent with his fastball today.”Severino walked only one batter (and hit another), but his haphazard fastball location forced him to work behind in the count often and allowed too many pitches over the plate.“As electric as his stuff is, command of the fastball is key for him,” Boone said. “That sets up everything else.”The Royals, averaging a little more than 3.5 runs per game, opened the scoring with a two-run double by Rosell Herrera in the third.“After that,” Severino said, “I wasn’t commanding my fastball.”It showed. In the fifth, Salvador Perez singled in two more runs with a line drive that zipped past Severino’s outstretched glove. The next batter, Lucas Duda, hit a two-run homer to right that made the score 6-0.The Yankees already added two of the prized pitching targets of the season, acquiring reliever Zach Britton from Baltimore and starter J.A. Happ from Toronto in the past week.But as they have struggled to gain ground on the A.L. East-leading Boston Red Sox, the Yankees almost certainly cannot afford to lose faith in their ace.“This is a bump in the season for him,” Boone said. “He has everything to right the ship.”It was the team’s first game without Judge, who will miss at least three weeks with a wrist fracture after being hit by a pitch in Thursday’s game. With Judge and catcher Gary Sanchez out until late August, the Yankees traded relievers Chasen Shreve and Giovanny Gallegos to the St. Louis Cardinals for 27-year-old first baseman Luke Voit and international signing bonus pool money late Saturday night.Even without Judge and Sanchez, the Yankees did not lack firepower. In the first game, Giancarlo Stanton took Judge’s customary No. 2 spot in the order and sent a monstrous home run 447 feet to center to put the Yankees on the board in the fifth.Stanton then reappeared with the bases loaded the following inning. A Yankees rally had trimmed the deficit to 6-4, knocked out the starting pitcher, Brad Keller, and brought the sold-out stadium crowd to its feet. Stanton took another prodigious hack and drove the ball hard to right, but it ran out of steam on the warning track to end the inning.In the seventh, Gleyber Torres doubled in a run with nobody out with a drive off the right-field wall. But as Didi Gregorius scored, Torres tried to stretch his hit into a triple and was thrown out easily.“In that moment, I think I’ve got a good opportunity to go to third base,” Torres said. “It was a bad decision.”It has been a tough week on the basepaths for the Yankees. On Monday, Sanchez jogged to first base after grounding to shortstop with the bases loaded, ending the game. And in the second inning on Saturday, again with the bases loaded, Tyler Wade hit into a double play that didn’t require the ball to travel beyond a foot. His tap off the plate was quickly smothered by the catcher, Perez, who stepped on home plate and tagged out Wade, standing flat-footed in the batter’s box.Boone did not criticize Wade for not running, calling it a “weird play.”But it was Torres’s attempt to make an extra play that ultimately cost the Yankees a chance to have the tying run in scoring position.“That definitely hurt and definitely was a mistake,” Boone said. “I like the fact that he was in position to make a read, but it wasn’t the right read.”In the following inning, a three-run homer by Kansas City’s Brian Goodwin put the game away.After jumping to a 2-0 lead in the first inning of the second game, the Yankees trailed by 4-3 in the bottom of the eighth, when a solo homer by Greg Bird tied the score. Aaron Hicks delivered the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded later in the inning.', 'Luis Severino Struggles Again as Yankees Split Doubleheader - The New York Times'), 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/sports/baseball/baseball-yankees-world-war-ll-ruth-williams.html': ('During World War II, baseball not only survived, it thrived. Games were turned into dazzling patriotic shows, and an extravaganza like the all-star game featuring the greats of the Yankees, Giants and Dodgers at Polo Grounds on Aug. 26, 1943, raised $800 million in war bonds.But another war-relief game that summer, which raised far less money, left an enduring mark on baseball.On July 28, 1943, the main event came after the Cleveland Indians beat the Yankees, 6-2, at Yankee Stadium.A United States Navy baseball team known as the Cloudbusters, manned by major league players training to become fighter pilots, took the field to face a blended Yankees and Indians team branded as the Yanklands.The team names may have been unfamiliar to the fans, but the players were not. The Yanklands were managed by Babe Ruth, who had been recruited to reel in dollars for the exhibition, one of several games that season designed to benefit war-relief efforts and the American Red Cross.The Cloudbusters, one of the country’s strongest military teams, had a star-studded lineup that included 24-year-old Ted Williams and his Boston Red Sox teammate, Johnny Pesky, along with Boston Braves hurler Johnny Sain and infielder Buddy Gremp. They were among the roughly 500 major league players who suspended their careers to serve in the war.Former Yankees serving as Cloudbuster coaches included Buddy Hassett, a native of the Bronx who had filled Lou Gehrig’s shoes at first base for the Yankees in 1942, and the rough-and-tumble outfielder Dusty Cooke, who played in the 1930s.With the presence of Babe Ruth, then 48, and Williams, Yankees president Ed Barrow expected the benefit game to do well at the box office. The local newspapers, including The New York Times, cooperated in generating publicity. Arthur Daley, a Times sports columnist, encouraged fans to turn out, writing, “Human nature being what it is, charity certainly seems to begin at home.”Daley described how Yankee Stadium would be dressed up for the day with “extra flourishes and furbelows.” And indeed, American flags fluttered from stadium towers, and red, white and blue banners flowed from the grandstands. Captain Sutherland’s Seventh Regiment Band, which had performed at Yankee Stadium since it opened in 1923, was booked to play singalong military tunes like “Anchors Aweigh.”Fans may not have realized that players like Williams and even coaches like Hassett were battered, bruised and exhausted from their physical training in the Navy. And the Cloudbusters, who played more than 40 games that season, did not earn a cent for making the kidney-jarring, overnight trek to New York on a bus.Everyone paid admission that day, including Ruth and Yankees management, reporters and umpires, even the players wearing jerseys for the Yankees and the Indians.Before the game, the Cloudbusters got to huddle in the locker room with Ruth, who nervously paced back and forth to make sure his No. 3 uniform was available. And when they took the field, they beat the Yanklands, 11-5, scoring seven runs in the seventh inning. They could say they beat some of the Yankees who went on to win the World Series that year. Hassett, the hometown boy, had two hits.In the end, although the Wednesday exhibition was scheduled later in the day to allow factory workers to attend after their shifts at shipyards and munitions plants, many seats at Yankee Stadium remained empty. The crowd of 27,281 generated about $30,000, a disappointment compared to war bond games that raised much more. Still, some moments would leave an impact in baseball history.Williams and Ruth had met for the first time just two weeks earlier at a military All-Star charity game at Fenway Park. Now they were together at Yankee Stadium, and the result was an iconic photograph of two of the greatest hitters of all time. It showed them sitting on footlockers with Williams outfitted in military khakis and lighting Ruth’s cigar.When Williams asked Ruth to sign a ball that day, it was believed to be the first and only instance in which he asked another celebrity for an autograph. The ball, which was later stolen and recovered, would become one of his prized possessions.That day Ruth wore his pinstriped uniform made for the famous 1942 film “The Pride of the Yankees.” When he trundled up to the plate to pinch-hit for the Yanklands against Sain in the sixth inning of the game, Ruth made his last plate appearance in his No. 3 jersey at Yankee Stadium. He hit one “mighty foul” into the stands, according to The Times, then walked.Ruth viewed the Yanklands gig as a job audition, envisioning a long sought-after managing offer from the Yankees, but he was merely a show pony that day to raise war-relief dollars. He never managed another major-league team and died five years later.Sain, then 25, was the last pitcher to face Ruth in an organized game. A few years later he became the first Major League Baseball player to throw a pitch to Jackie Robinson.Hassett, who served in the Navy from 1943 to 1945, never made it back to the major leagues after the war, having sacrificed prime playing years. Working for a trucking company well into his 80s, Hassett would become a poster child for players who were denied major league pensions after their careers were interrupted to serve in the war. He died in 1997 at 85.Of the major league players who served in the war, fewer than 45 are still alive. But the memories of that era, including that unusual doubleheader in 1943, endure.', 'First, the Yankees Played the Indians. Then World War ll Took the Field. - The New York Times')}\n"
